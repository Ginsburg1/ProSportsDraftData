"A.J. Bouye",1
"A.J. Bouye, Chidobe Awuzie",1
"A.J. Bouye.  Smith is reminiscent of Bouye. Both have toughness, instincts, good size, and a gritty style of play. Bouye (6-0, 191) had issues with grabbing too much, but once Smith improved on that weakness, he became a very good starter for a few seasons.",2
"A.J. Bouye. Team sources suggested Bouye as a player who Williams was similar to, and Bouye makes a ton of sense. Bouye had some decent seasons with Texans and Jaguars, showing size and coverage ability. When Bouye had problems, he grabbed too much, and that is a similar issue for Williams. In the NFL, Williams could be a cornerback comparable to Bouye.",1
"A.J. Brown (with more wiggle)",1
"A.J. Brown. Burks is very similar to A.J. Brown coming out of Ole Miss, and I believe that Burks will be an effective No. 1 receiver like Brown is in the NFL. Brown (6-0, 226) faced questions about how fast he was, which led to him being a second-round pick, but like Burks, Brown plays plenty fast enough while being an excellent runner after the catch. Burks played similarly for Arkansas. Like Brown, Burks could go in the second round, but Burks might get picked in the back half of the first round, which is where Brown probably should have gone.",1
"A.J. EPENESA",1
"A.J. Epenesa.  Foskey is reminiscent of Epenesa coming out of Iowa. Both are tough at the point of attack to set the edge and provide solid run defense. They put together speed and sack production in college, but stiffness is a problem for performing effectively against NFL offensive tackles. As pro, I could see Foskey being like Epenesa as a contributor in the pass rush, but not being an elite sack producer.",1
"A.J. Green",1
"A.J. Green.  Some team sources have said that Johnston’s skill set is similar to Green coming out of Georgia in 2011. If Johnston can stay healthy, he could be an elite receiver like Green was in his prime years for Cincinnati.",1
"A.J. Klein",1
"A.J. TERRELL",2
"A.J. Terrell. Booth reminds me of Terrell coming out of Clemson in 2020. Both have good skill sets with upside. They didn’t always play consistently or up to their potential in college, but they clearly were ascending players. Terrell (6-1, 195) and Booth are virtually the same size, and they play the game very similarly after being developed by the same college coaching staff. Terrell has turned into an excellent corner for the Falcons, and if Booth receives good coaching, he could be a good corner early in his pro career as well.",1

"Aaron Donald",1
"Aaron Donald.  At the combine, one NFC general manager picking outside of the top 10 said this of Thomas, “Thomas is going higher; many view him as a poor-man’s Aaron Donald.” Other teams also mentioned him as a poor-man’s Aaron Donald. Thomas needs to gain weight in order to be similar size to Donald, and Donald is more explosive. However, Thomas’ style of play at Stanford looked a lot like Donald.;NFL Matches:  San Francisco, Chicago, Carolina, Cincinnati, New Orleans, Cleveland, Arizona, Indianapolis, Baltimore and Washington",1
"Aaron Donald.  Some have compared Allen to Ndamukong Suh, which I think is a fair comparison as well. I went with Donald because Donald and Allen are very similar in size and both are tremendous interior pass-rushers. Each was very consistent in college at getting to the quarterback with an excellent combination of strength and speed. Allen is also good off the field, like Donald, where as Suh can be selfish and a negative presence in the locker room. In the NFL, I think Allen will be a defensive lineman similar to Donald.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, San Francisco, Chicago, Jacksonville, Carolina, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Baltimore and Washington",1
"Aaron Jones",2
"Aaron Kampman. Nassib reminds me of a bigger, slower version of Kampman. Kampman had some good seasons with the Packers and totaled 58 sacks in his career. Like Nassib, Kampman wasn’t the fastest or strongest edge rusher, but he had a nose for the quarterback and gave relentless effort. Kampman maxed out as a player, and I could see Nassib being a similar caliber edge rusher in his pro career.;NFL Matches:  Jacksonville, Baltimore, Dallas, Detroit, New York Giants, Tampa Bay, Oakland, Chicago, Atlanta and Miami",1
"Aaron Schobel",1
"Aaron Williams",1
"Abry Jones",1
"Adam Humphries",1
"Adam Jones.  Sources have compared Jackson to Jones, which makes a lot of sense. They are almost identical in size; both are extremely fast with quick feet, an ability to run with receivers to prevent separation, and can star on special teams. In the NFL, I think Jackson will be a cornerback comparable to Jones, with the exception that Jackson doesn’t have off-the-field issues like Jones did in the early portion of his career. Another comparison that scouts have mentioned for Jackson is a faster version of Janoris Jenkins.;NFL Matches:  Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Baltimore, Tennessee, Detroit, Miami, Oakland, Kansas City, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago, New York Jets, New Orleans and Buffalo",1
"Adoree' Jackson",1
"Adrian Amos",1
"Adrian Clayborn",1
"Adrian Peterson.  In terms of running style, Fournette’s closest comparison is Peterson. Both have the power to run through defenders, the speed to run away from them, and the elusiveness to dodge them in the open field. Peterson is a devastating runner capable of putting his team on his back and carrying the team to wins. Fournette has similar potential for the NFL. I think Fournette could end up being a dominant runner of Peterson’s caliber.;NFL Matches:  San Francisco, Jacksonville, New York Jets, Carolina and Cincinnati ;There are a lot of teams that could take Fournette even though they don’t have a need at the position because he is an electric play-maker who could have a huge impact at providing wins for his team. At the top of the 2017 NFL Draft, Fournette could be a turnaround piece for depressed franchises. ;San Francisco was hoping for a breakout year from Carlos Hyde, but it didn’t happen. Hyde has had durability problems in his first three seasons and will be entering the final year of his contract. Fournette would be an instant upgrade for the 49ers’ offense. ;The Jaguars could consider taking Fournette because he is such a special talent. Tom Coughlin isn’t tied to the drafting of T.J. Yeldon or the signing of Chris Ivory. Additionally, having a weapon like Fournette could help the Jaguars’ attempt to salvage Blake Bortles before he goes bust.",1
"Adrian Wilson. I think that James could be similar to Wilson at the next level. For a decade, Wilson was one of the best strong safeties in the NFL. He was a third-round pick in 2001 out of N.C. State, but obviously he should have been drafted higher. James will be a first-rounder like Wilson should have been.",1
"Adrian Wilson. In the NFL, I think that Adams could be a similar player to Wilson. Wilson spent a decade as one of the best strong safeties in the NFL. He was a third-round pick in 2001 out of N.C. State, but obviously Wilson should have been drafted higher. Both Wilson and Adams are physical football players who are always around the ball. Wilson (6-3, 230) is bigger than Adams, but when Wilson entered the NFL, he was 213 pounds. Over his impressive career, Wilson was a five-time Pro Bowler and three-time All-Pro selection. Adams has a similar game to Wilson and could be a potential special strong safety.;NFL Matches:  Tennessee, Los Angeles Chargers, Carolina, Cincinnati, Buffalo, New Orleans, Cleveland",1
"Adrian Wilson. In the NFL, I think that Neal could be a poor man’s version of Wilson. For a decade, Wilson was one of the best strong safeties in the league. He was a third-round pick in 2001 out of N.C. State, but obviously Wilson should have been drafted higher.",1
"Agim McNeil.  Ika is akin to a bigger version of McNeil coming out of N.C. State. McNeil is a forceful run-stuffer who occasionally provides a bull rush to get after the quarterback. McNeil was an excellent value as a third-round pick for the Lions in 2021, and Ika could be similar selection this year in the 2023 NFL Draft.",1
"Ahkello Witherspoon",1
"Ahmad Bradshaw",2
"Ahmad Brooks",1
"Ahtyba Rubin",2
"Akhello Witherspoon.  I don’t like to use players who are so young in their NFL careers, but in speaking to team sources, Witherspoon was the player who Oliver was compared to. Witherspoon is taller and longer than Oliver, but Oliver is tougher and more physical. They both have a good combination of size, speed, and the ability to be press-man cornerbacks. Witherspoon was a third-round pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, and Oliver should go higher this year.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, San Francisco, Green Bay, Los Angeles Chargers, Dallas, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Atlanta, New Orleans, Minnesota, New England, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Indianapolis and Tampa Bay ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Oliver in the 2018 NFL Draft. Late in the first round, there are some options. Buffalo could consider Oliver because the team has to find a replacement for Ronald Darby. The Saints have bigger needs, but they also might consider a corner if he’s the best player available, plus that would give them a partner to go with Marshon Lattimore. Oliver could be in play for the Saints. Atlanta could use a cornerback to replace Jalen Collins. The Vikings, meanwhile, have to consider a replacement for Terrance Newman, while the Bengals could use a replacement for Adam Jones. Oliver could interest both Minnesota and Cincinnati. ;The Patriots could consider taking Oliver with one of their first-round picks or their high second-round pick. Malcolm Butler left in free agency, while Stephon Gilmore was disappointing in his first year in Foxborough. New England’s Super Bowl opponent also could consider Oliver. Philadelphia may not sign Darby to a long-term extension, and Oliver could be selected as a future replacement for the Eagles.",1

"Alec Ogletree",1
"Alex Cappa",1

"Alex Highsmith.  Barno reminds me of Highsmith coming out of Charlotte. Highsmith (6-4, 242) and Barno are similar in size, but Highsmith is a tougher run defender. Highsmith was a late third-round pick in 2020, and Barno could be a mid-rounder this year.",1
"Alex Lewis",1
"Alex Redmond",1
"Alex Smith",1
"Alex Smith.  During the 2018 season, Finley repeatedly reminded me of a less athletic version of Smith. Finley does not have Smith’s athleticism and running ability, but they have a similar style of play as passers. In the NFL, I could see Finley being a quarterback like Smith who is a slightly above-average starter, but not elite or special.;NFL Matches:  New York Giants, Jacksonville, Tampa Bay, Denver, Cincinnati, Miami, Washington, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles Chargers, New England",1
"Alexander Mattison",1
"Alfred Morris",1
"Alge Crumpler",1
"Ali Marpet",2
"Ali Marpet.  Some sources compared Mauch to Marpet. That makes sense because both were small-school prospects with good skill sets who lacked strength entering the next level. After being a second-round pick, Marpet was a very good guard for the Buccaneers before ending his career early. Mauch could also go in Round 2 this year.",1
"Allen Bailey.  Davidson reminds me some of a better version of Bailey. Bailey (6-3, 288) and Davidson are almost identical in size, with both being hard-nosed football players who display toughness at the point of attack. Bailey had six sacks in 2018, and in the NFL, I think Davidson will top out in the 6-8 sack range during the good years of his career.",1
"Allen Bailey.  Hand reminds me of Bailey, and they have a lot of similarities. Bailey (6-3, 288) is almost identical in size to Hand, and Bailey showed athleticism, quickness, and movement skills when he was in college in Miami. Bailey was a third-round pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, and Hand should also be a second-day pick in his draft class. As a pro, Bailey has been a reliable, but unspectacular, five-technique for Kansas City. I could see Hand being a similar player in the NFL.;NFL Matches:  New England, New York Jets, Tennessee, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Denver, Oakland, Detroit, Buffalo and Atlanta",1
"Allen Bailey.  Paschal is reminiscent of Bailey coming out of Miami. Bailey (6-3, 288) and Paschal are similar in size. As Paschal ages in a pro strength program, he probably will put on weight and add about 10 pounds to be nearly identical to Bailey. Both are hard-nosed football players who are tough at the point of attack. Bailey had six sacks in 2018, and in the NFL, I think Paschal will top out in the 6-8 sacks range in the good years of his career.",1
"Allen Hurns",1
"Allen Hurns.  Team sources compared Ridley to Hurns, which makes a lot of sense. Hurns (6-1, 208) and Ridley are nearly identical in size. While they are not overly fast, they combine good hands with crafty route-running. Hurns had a big 2015 season, but he is better as a No. 2 or No. 3 receiver. Ridley could be a similar caliber pro who produces more than Hurns if he lands with a good quarterback.;NFL Matches:  New York Jets, Buffalo, Miami, New England, Baltimore, Cleveland, Tennessee, Denver, Green Bay, San Francisco, Arizona, Dallas, New Orleans, Oakland",1
"Allen Robinson",2
"Alshon Jeffery",1
"Alshon Jeffery.  Sutton is an inch taller than Jeffery, but they are the same weight. Both of them are big wideouts who consistently win contested catches and are excellent red-zone receivers. Jeffery has been a size mismatch problem in the NFL, and Sutton should provide that as well. I think Sutton could be a better version of Jeffery in the NFL.;NFL Matches:  Chicago, San Francisco, Miami, Washington, Arizona, Green Bay, Baltimore, Dallas, Buffalo, Carolina, New Orleans and Jacksonville ;There are a lot of teams that could be in the market for a wide receiver upgrade in the 2018 NFL Draft. The Bears and 49ers both could consider more receiving talent. Chicago signed two receivers for Mitch Trubisky, so Sutton going to the Bears seems unlikely. Sutton would be a nice fit for Kyle Shanahan across from Marquise Goodwin, but going with the ninth-overall pick seems too high for Sutton. ;In the teens, there are a lot of potential landing spots for Sutton. The Dolphins could consider bringing Sutton to South Florida as they need to replace Jarvis Landry. The Redskins have had some turnover at receiver, and Sutton could finish off their receiving corps. He would be a good fit in Jay Gruden’s offense. ;Green Bay could use more receiving talent after moving on from Jordy Nelson. Sutton would be a nice fit in the Packers’ offense. He could be a valuable No. 1 receiver for the sunset seasons of Aaron Rodgers’ career. ;Arizona has to consider life after Larry Fitzgerald and could use more receiving talent around the future Hall of Famer. If the Cardinals miss out on a quarterback in the first round, Sutton could be a fit for them. ;At No. 16, the Ravens need a No. 1 receiver, and Sutton could be a weapon for them across from Michael Crabtree. Three picks later, Sutton could land in Dallas. There have been rumblings of the Cowboys moving on from Dez Bryant before long, and Sutton could replace Bryant as the No. 1 receiver for Dak Prescott. The Cowboys have shown a lot of interest in Sutton, including having head coach Jason Garrett work him out at his pro day. Sutton is definitely in play for Dallas.",1
"Alshon Jeffery. Metcalf and Jeffery (6-3, 218) are similar receivers as size mismatches who have the speed to make plays downfield. They carry their weight differently, as Metcalf is all muscle while Jeffery has had bad-weight issues. In the NFL, I could see Metcalf being a receiver similar to Jeffery.;NFL Matches:  New York Jets, Buffalo, Miami, New England, Washington, Cleveland, Baltimore, Oakland, Indianapolis, Green Bay, Arizona, San Francisco and Jacksonville",1
"Alterraun Verner.  Verner is a tough corner who has good ball skills and instincts. Like King, Verner has some speed and athletic limitations. However, he used his strengths to carve out a quality career with some good seasons. I could see King being an NFL player comparable to Verner if he remains at corner.;NFL Matches:  Indianapolis, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Tennessee, Detroit, Miami, Oakland, Kansas City, Dallas, Cleveland, Chicago, New York Jets, New Orleans and Buffalo",1
"Alvin Bailey",2
"Alvin Kamara",1
"Alvin Kamara.  Some team sources think Gibbs could be used like Alvin Kamara in the NFL. They have similar skill sets with devastating speed, running ability, receiving ability, and big-play potential.",1
"Alvin Kamara.  Some team sources think Swift could be used like Alvin Kamara in the NFL. They have similar skill sets with devastating speed, running ability, receiving ability, and big-play potential. Kamara might be a better and more natural receiver, while Swift is a stronger and more natural runner.",1
"Amani Oruwariye",2
"Amari Cooper.  Ridley is very similar to Cooper as a player. Both of them are fast receivers who are good route-runners, sudden in and out of their breaks, challenge defenses with their speed, and are potential No. 1 receivers for an offense. Cooper was the fourth-overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, and Ridley also could go early in the 2018 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Chicago, San Francisco, Miami, Washington, Arizona, Green Bay, Baltimore, Dallas and Buffalo ;There are a lot of teams that could be in the market for a wide receiver upgrade in the 2018 NFL Draft.

The Dolphins could consider bringing Ridley back to South Florida as they need to replace Jarvis Landry. The Redskins have had some turnover at receiver, and Ridley could still finish off their receiving corps. He would be a good fit in Jay Gruden’s offense. ;Green Bay could use more receiving talent after moving on from Jordy Nelson. Arizona has to consider life after Larry Fitzgerald and could use more receiving talent around the future Hall of Famer. ;At 16, the Ravens need a No. 1 receiver, and Ridley could be a vertical weapon to go across from Michael Crabtree. Three picks later, Ridley could land in Dallas. There have been rumblings of the Cowboys moving on from Dez Bryant before long, and Ridley could replace Bryant as the No. 1 receiver for Dak Prescott.",1
"Amari Cooper. Sources from multiple teams think Chase could be a better version of Amari Cooper for the NFL.",1
"Andre Branch",2
"Andre Gurode.  Hill reminds me of Gurode, and if Hill loses some weight, I think he could be a comparable center to Gurode. Gurode (6-4, 320) was a Pro Bowler with the Cowboys and had center/guard flexibility along with big size. Hill could be similar, and if Hill had kept his weight in check, he could have been a second-round pick like Gurode was coming out of Colorado.",1
"Andre Holmes",2
"Andre Roberts",1
"Andrew Billings",1
"Andrew Luck",1
"Andrew Norwell.  Smith’s steady play reminds me of Norwell. They both are 6-foot-6, and Norwell weighs a little more than Smith. Norwell (6-6, 325) is an effective run and pass blocker. In the NFL, I think Smith could be a similar blocker.;NFL Matches:  Denver, Tampa Bay, Carolina, Chicago, Cincinnati, Seattle, Baltimore, Miami, San Francisco, Jacksonville and Indianapolis ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Smith in the 2018 NFL Draft. One of the biggest needs on the Dolphins’ roster is guard talent. At Miami’s second-round pick, Smith could be a great fit for the team as a safe pick and plug-and-play starter. ;Denver or Tampa Bay could take Notre Dame guard Quenton Nelson in the first round. Whichever doesn’t land Nelson could target Smith in the second round. Staying in the NFC South, Carolina lost Norwell in free agency and has shown a lot of interest in Smith. He could be a plug-and-play second-round pick for the Panthers. ;Cincinnati definitely needs to improve its offensive line, so Smith could be in play for the Bengals as the true replacement to Kevin Zeitler. The Bears also could consider looking to get a guard upgrade.",1
"Andrew Norwell. Norwell went undrafted, but has turned into a starting guard for Carolina. Norwell (6-6, 325) and Drango are almost identical in size. Norwell can get movement in the ground game and showed surprising skills at not allowing pressure on Cam Newton. If Drango lands with good coaching and plays right or left guard, I think he could have a strong start to his career like Norwell has for Carolina.;NFL Matches:  Indianapolis, San Diego, Miami, Green Bay, San Francisco, Philadelphia, New York Jets, Buffalo, New England, Denver, Kansas City and Seattle",1
"Andrew Thomas",1
"Andrew Wylie",1
"Andrew Wylie. Morris reminds me of Wylie playing right tackle for the Chiefs in 2022. In the NFL, Morris could be a decent, but not special, starter similar to Wylie.",1
"Andy Dalton (in prime years)",1
"Andy Dalton.  Burrow is a unique prospect and difficult to make an easy comparison to. What NFL team evaluators think is infinitely more important than my opinion on a player. Thus, I reached out to them to get their suggestions on a comparison for Burrow. One top executive said Russell Wilson for Burrow’s style of play, but they acknowledged that Wilson’s arm is much stronger than Burrow. As stated above, multiple sources said Burrow’s skill set is in line with Andy Dalton’s, so that could be the closest thing to Burrow in terms of arm, athleticism and size. ;One director of college scouting said Ryan Tannehill was a solid comparison. They said that Burrow was a better decision-maker and fiery leader while Tannehill was a better runner and has a stronger arm. ;Another comparison for Burrow that was suggested by one director of college scouting was Mitch Trubisky. Both have good but not elite skill sets. In college, they showed accuracy as passers with the ability to be rhythm throwers who also had the mobility to make plays with their feet. Teams liked the intangibles on Trubisky as well, and both Burrow and Trubisky were 1-year wonders as players.",1
"Andy Dalton.  In terms of skill set and playing style, Mills reminds me of Dalton. If Mills turns into a solid backup or starter, he could be a Dalton-style quarterback.",1
"Andy Dalton.  Some team sources have compared Thorson to Andy Dalton, which makes sense. Thorson is bigger than Dalton, but both of them can be dangerous quarterbacks when things are clicking well for them. They also can have struggles when things aren’t going well around them. Dalton was a second-round pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, and Thorson could go in Round 2 this year.;NFL Matches:  New England, New York Giants, Tampa Bay, Carolina, Denver, Cincinnati, Miami, Washington, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles Chargers",1
"Andy Levitre.  Levitre is a technician offensive lineman who is a good fit in a zone-blocking scheme. Feeney could be similar as he lacks strength in his base, and that can be an issue for Levitre. Levitre was a second-round pick by Buffalo in the 2009 NFL Draft, and Feeney could go in the same range.;NFL Matches:  Jacksonville, Indianapolis, Baltimore, Denver, Minnesota, Seattle and Los Angeles Chargers",1
"Anquan Boldin",2
"Anthony Barr",2
"Anthony Barr.  In some ways, Sanders compares well to Barr. Both were fast off the edge with the ability to hunt the quarterback. They also were similarly sizes. Barr was stronger and more physical as a run defender, but both are tweener linebacker/defensive ends.",1
"Anthony Barr.  Team sources compared Floyd to Barr. However, they think that Floyd is more explosive and athletic than Barr, but Barr is stronger and more physical.;NFL Matches:  Baltimore, Tampa Bay, New York Giants, Detroit, Oakland, Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Cleveland",1
"Anthony Barr/Whitney Mercilus. In the NFL, I could see Chaisson being a defender similar to Barr if he’s in a 4-3 defense. Barr (6-5, 255) is almost identical size to Chaisson and both are impactful edge defenders. Chaisson might have a little more twitch and explosion, while Barr is stronger and tougher in run defense. Barr went in the top 20 of during the 2014 NFL Draft and Chaisson could follow suit this year.",1
"Anthony Brown",1
"Anthony Castonzo. Ramczyk reminds me of Castonzo. Both are quality blockers, but not dominant. Neither blasts defenders off the line in the ground game or is a shutdown pass protector. However, they are generally reliable to get the job done. They are almost identical in size as well. Castonzo was taken in the back half of the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft, and Ramczyk could go in the same range. I think Ramczyk would be an NFL left tackle comparable to Castonzo.;NFL Matches:  Carolina, Buffalo, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Baltimore, Oakland, Houston, Denver, Minnesota, Seattle, Los Angeles Chargers",1
"Anthony Chickillo",1
"Anthony Harris",1
"Anthony Miller",1
"Anthony Walker",1
"Anthony Zettel",1
"Antoine Bethea.  There are a lot of similarities between Savage and Bethea. Both are rangy free safeties who make big, clutch plays for their defenses off of instincts and speed. Bethea (5-11, 206) and Savage are almost identical in size. At the combine in 2006, Bethea weighed in at 196 and ran the 40 in 4.39 seconds, almost identical to Savage. In the NFL, I could see Savage having a long productive career like Bethea has had.;NFL Matches:  Los Angeles Rams, New England, Arizona, San Francisco, Tampa Bay, Carolina, Tennessee, Houston, Indianapolis, Dallas",1
"Antoine Cason",1
"Antonio Brown",1
"Antonio Brown  Smith is a difficult player to make a comparison for because of his build, but in terms of the style of play, Smith reminds me of Brown during his glory years with the Steelers. Smith’s tremendous route-running, speed, and incredible yards-after-the-catch skills remind me of that Antonio Brown. The 5-foot-10, 185-pound Brown is undersized as well. I could see Smith being a similar pro receiver to Brown.",2

"Antwaan Randle El",1
"Antwan Odom",1
"Aqib Talib",1
"Aqib Talib.  Jackson is a bit of a poor-man’s Talib. Talib is faster, more athletic and twitchier player. Jackson is a little less speedy and athletic, but Jackson is more disciplined and is not a gambler like Talib can be. Both of them have excellent instincts with tremendous ball skills and are true ballhawks to take the ball away. They also are tall, long, and smooth corners. Talib went in the back half of the first round in the 2008 NFL Draft, and Jackson could go in the same range. In the NFL, I think Jackson could be a less-spectacular but steadier version of Talib.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, San Francisco, Green Bay, Los Angeles Chargers, Seattle, Dallas, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Atlanta, New Orleans, Minnesota, New England, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Indianapolis and Tampa Bay ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Jackson in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Raiders and 49ers both could use more cornerback help from Round 1. One would have thought that going as a top-10 pick could be too high for Jackson, but it might not be. Oakland has shown a lot of interest in Jackson and has a huge need at cornerback, and he could form a dynamite tandem with Gareon Conley. Jon Gruden loved Talib coming out of Kansas and wisely drafted him for Tampa Bay. Jackson could remind Gruden of Talib. ;Green Bay has used a lot of picks on cornerbacks, but it remains a position to potentially address for the Packers. Jackson could get consideration as a cover corner for them. In Los Angeles, the Chargers could use a cornerback to go with Casey Hayward. Jason Verrett is nearing the end of his contract and has had durability issues.",2
"Aqib Talib. Gonzalez reminds me of Talib in terms of being big, long, fast, athletic, and a willing tackler. Talib had better ball skills coming out of Kansas, while Gonzalez is more disciplined and not as much of a gambler as Talib. Like Talib did, Gonzalez has issues with consistency.",1
"Arden Key",1
"Arian Foster.  In terms of running style, there wasn’t an obvious comparison for Mixon; however, there were moments where he reminded me of Foster (6-1, 227). They are identical in size with a rare combination of size, athleticism, quickness, cutting ability, and versatility. Foster was a very good receiver like Mixon, too. They also both have good, though not elite, speed, and both can run upright at times. As a runner, Mixon could be a bit faster where as Foster was smoother. Another similarity is that Foster had some off-the-field issues to manage just as Mixon does.;NFL Matches:  Indianapolis, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Tampa Bay, Green Bay, New York Giants, Detroit, New York Jets, Carolina and Minnesota ;There are a lot of teams that could take Mixon. In the second round, a number of franchises could consider taking a running back. The Jets signed Matt Forte, but the skilled veteran is aging. Mixon could make a big difference for whoever is the team’s next starting quarterback after Josh McCown in Christian Hackenberg or Bryce Petty. ;Adding Mixon to Cam Newton could be a dynamic combination of running ability for the Panthers. Jonathan Stewart recently turned 30 and has had durability throughout his career. If Mixon gets to one of the Panthers’ second-round picks, he could be too good to pass up if they don’t take a running back in Round 1. ;There are a lot of potential landing spots for Mixon in the middle of the second round. The Colts, Eagles and Ravens all need long-term starting running backs. Of those three, the Colts are probably the least likely to take a tailback because of the vast needs on the defensive side of the ball and Mixon’s off-the-field issues. Philadelphia with Doug Pederson’s offense would be a good fit for Mixon. Baltimore has tried a few different runners, but needs a lead back to carry its ground game. Tampa Bay could consider taking Mixon given Doug Martin’s situation and his uncertain future with the team. ;In the NFC North, the Packers lost Eddie Lacy this offseason, and they will need a starting running back. Mixon would add a dynamic presence to Green Bay’s offense. The Lions had the 30th-ranked rushing offense in 2016, while Ameer Abdullah hasn’t panned out thus far. The Vikings need a replacement for Adrian Peterson, and Mixon is a lot more talented than Latavius Murray. ;The Giants fielded the 29th-ranked rushing offense in 2016 and badly need some talent in the backfield. Mixon would bring a play-making presence to the team’s backfield.",1
"Arian Foster.  Some team sources said Spiller reminds them of Foster. It makes sense, as Foster was a big back who was a skilled receiver. Spiller is similar. He runs a little tougher than Foster did, while Foster had more speed. In the NFL, it would not surprise me if Spiller ends up being similar, but maybe not quite as good, as Foster was in his prime with the Texans.",1
"Arian Foster.  Team sources suggested Foster as a comparison for Johnson. They said that Foster was a thicker, heavier version, but they are similar as a smooth runners who weave through a defense. Foster also was a receiving threat like Johnson was at Auburn. Foster went undrafted because of a variety of issues, but the Texans were very wise to sign him as he turned into one of the best running backs in the NFL during his prime. Johnson is grading out on the second day of the 2018 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, New York Giants, Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, Oakland, Detroit, San Francisco and Pittsburgh ;There are a lot of teams that could consider taking Johnson on the second day of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Browns moved on from Isaiah Crowell and signed Carlos Hyde. If they don’t land Saquon Barkley in the first round, Johnson could make sense for their third-round pick.",1
"Arik Armstead",1
"Arik Armstead.  Odeyingbo’s skill set is reminiscent of Armstead’s. Armstead (6-7, 290) has a long frame with quickness and athleticism, and if Odeyingbo adds weight as he ages, he could top out around Armstead’s weight and show a similar ability to play inside or outside on the defensive line. If Odeyingbo had better support, development, and circumstances in college, he could have been a first-round pick because he has that type of skill set. I think Odeyingbo could end up as a good pro like Armstead has become for San Francisco.",1
"Armon Watts",1
"Artie Burns",2
"Artie Burns. In surveying team sources, the comparisons returned for Stevenson were Pierre Desir, Michael Jackson, David Emerson and Burns. Burns (6-0, 197) and Stevenson are nearly identical in size while also possessing athleticism and speed. However, Burns was also very streaky and inconsistent coming out of Miami, and those issues plague Stevenson as well. Burns was a late first-round pick in 2016, and Stevenson could be a late first-rounder in the 2023 NFL Draft.",1

"Barry Sanders.  I don’t like to pick Hall of Famers for the player comparison, but watching Barkley reminds me of watching Barry Sanders during his amazing career for the Lions. The combination of natural running skills with extreme speed and a strong build is truly rare. Barkley can do anything on a football field, even dominating good opponents. Sanders was like that in his amazing career filled with highlight-reel runs and sheer domination. Sanders was a top-five pick, and Barkley is going to be a top-five choice as well. If Barkley doesn’t get injured, I think he could be a back who is similar to Sanders during his NFL career.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, New York Giants, New York Jets, Indianapolis, Denver, Tampa Bay and San Francisco ;As the best player in the 2018 NFL Draft, Barkley is a lock to go in the top five. Cleveland needs a feature back, and I know Browns sources that love Barkley.

"Benardrick McKinney",1
"Benardrick McKinney.  Edmunds is a very difficult player to find a good comparison to because he is such a unique prospect with his size, speed and athleticism. In speaking with sources, McKinney came up as a similar player, although Edmunds is a rich man’s version, or a McKinney on steroids. McKinney was 6-foot-4, 246 pounds coming out of Mississippi State. Similar to Edmunds, McKinney was a tough run defender with good instincts with size, quickness and athleticism to also rush off the edge. Edmunds is a little taller and lighter, but is more explosive and athletic than McKinney. In the early going of his NFL career, McKinney has been a good run defender who also is a dangerous blitzer. Edmunds could be similar except he brings along more pass-coverage skills than McKinney possesses. In the 2015 NFL Draft, McKinney was a high second-round pick, but he should have been a first-rounder. Teams won’t make that mistake with Edmunds, who will likely be selected early on Thursday night of the 2018 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Indianapolis, Chicago, San Francisco, Oakland, Miami, Green Bay, Seattle, Dallas and Detroit ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Edmunds in the 2018 NFL Draft. Perhaps the highest that Edmunds could hope to go would be to Indianapolis. The Colts badly needs to improve their linebacking corps, and Edmunds would give them a long-term defensive building block. ;Chicago looks like a very likely landing spot for Edmunds. The Bears need one more linebacker to finish off their front seven. Edmunds could be a dynamic player on the other side from Leonard Floyd, and Edmunds also could play on the inside of Vic Fangio’s defense. Edmunds fits in with a lot of other very young high-upside talents who Ryan Pace has drafted in the first round: Mitch Trubisky, Leonard Floyd, and Kevin White. ;The 49ers could consider taking Edmunds. Given all the problems that Reuben Foster has had off the field, along with dealing a lot of injuries, Edmunds could interest John Lynch as the long-term linebacker to build the San Francisco defense around. ;The Raiders have to improve the middle of their defense and the front seven. Edmunds would be an upgrade to their rush defense and pass coverage. He would give them a big upgrade on the other side from Khalil Mack.",1
"Bennie Logan.  Logan turned out to be a steal for the Eagles from the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft. Logan (6-2, 315) is a good athlete who is fast and quick, and Godchaux has similar characteristics.

Both of them are terrible at passing in the face of a pass rush and have serious problems with their field vision. They take far too many sacks and put too much pressure on the offensive line. Both Gabbert and Kaaya also lack leadership traits that NFL teams want out of their starting quarterbacks. In the NFL, I could see Kaaya being a quarterback comparable to Gabbert.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, San Francisco, Chicago, Jacksonville, New Orleans, Los Angeles Chargers, Arizona, Houston, Kansas City, New York Giants and Pittsburgh ;There are a lot of quarterback-needy teams in the NFL, and that will help Kaaya’s chances of being drafted higher than where he should go. Obviously, the Browns are in dire need of a solution to their quarterback quandary. Cleveland also is loaded with draft picks, including two in the first round, two in the second, and one in the third. Kaaya could be a candidate for the Browns on Day 2 or on Day 3.",1

Both of them can be inconsistent with stretches of good play and then times during which they struggle with their issues.",1
"Blake Bortles.  Wentz is a very unique player, so it is tough to find a comparison for him. In speaking with scouts, they feel the same way and think that his uniqueness sets him apart. Collectively, we felt that Wentz was an upgraded version of Bortles as a prospect. Wentz and Bortles have a similar skill set with size, arm strength and athleticism. However, Wentz has a bit more talent in every attribute. In terms of NFL effectiveness, I could see Wentz panning out and being a quarterback of a similar caliber to Matt Ryan or Joe Flacco.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, San Diego, Dallas, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Houston, New York Jets and Buffalo",1
"Blake Bortles/Brock Osweiler.  As a player, Lynch reminds me of a mix of Bortles and Osweiler. His build is similar to Osweiler’s, while the style of play is similar to Bortles. Both Bortles and Osweiler were projects entering the NFL, and Lynch falls into that mold. Bortles wasn’t a quarterback prospect who graded out in the top five, but he went there out of need. The exact same scenario could play out for Lynch. If Lynch lands in the right situation with good coaches, I could see him being a quarterback on a par with Bortles in the early going of his career.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, Dallas, San Francisco, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Houston, New York Jets and Buffalo",1

Unfortunately, it wouldn’t be surprising if Baker had similar injury issues as he is even thinner than Sanders was. Injuries have also hurt Ward (5-11, 193) in his young NFL career.

Joseph could follow a similar path if immaturity doesn’t derail his potential for a pro career.",1

"Brandin Cooks.  Team sources agree that Cooks is a pretty good comparison, except they think that Ross could be a more natural receiver than Cooks.

Cooks went in the back half of the first round in his draft class, and Ross could go in a similar range.;NFL Matches:  Buffalo, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Tennessee, Denver, Kansas City and Dallas",1
"Brandon Brooks",1
"Brandon Brooks. Brooks (6-5, 335) played right tackle in college but has turned into a Pro Bowl guard. Even though he is big, Brooks is not a true road-grader. Brooks also is a surprisingly good athlete who is light on his feet for such big blocker. In the NFL, I think Ford could be a Pro Bowl-caliber blocker like Brooks has been for the Eagles and Texans.;NFL Matches:  Arizona, Buffalo, Cleveland, Tampa Bay, Carolina, Philadelphia, Houston, Minnesota, Los Angeles Rams",1
"Brandon Browner. After going undrafted, Browner was with the Broncos for a couple of seasons before playing in Canada for four years. He broke out with the Seahawks and became a good player for them. He was part of their dominant secondary in their Super Bowl in 2013 and won the Super Bowl a year later with New England. Browner (6-4, 221) is a huge corner to match up against big receivers. King has a similar skill set. In the NFL, I see King being a cornerback similar to Browner, but King could end up being better and more consistent.;NFL Matches:  Dallas, Green Bay, Cleveland, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles Chargers, Buffalo, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Baltimore, Washington, Detroit, Miami, Oakland and Houston",1
"Brandon Browner. Mukuamu reminds me of a thinner Browner. Browner (6-4, 220) was a successful press-man corner for a time with the Seahawks.

"Brandon Jacobs.  Sources with multiple teams have compared Henry to Jacobs, and there are obvious parallels between them. Jacobs (6-4, 264) and Henry are both extremely tall for running backs. They also have a downhill running style with physicality. Henry could have a faster second gear than Jacobs. Another similar running back to Henry is Titans great Eddie George (6-3, 235), but George ran lower and had more shiftiness. In the NFL, Henry’s closest comparison would be Jacobs, the Giants’ all-time leader in rushing touchdown.;NFL Matches:  Houston, Carolina, Arizona, New England, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Tennessee, New York Jets, Miami, Washington, Chicago and Tampa Bay",1
"Brandon Linder",1
"Brandon Marshall.  Brothers kind of reminds me of Marshall. They both are quality run defenders who can contribute in pass coverage. Brothers will need some work to be on Marshall’s level in pass coverage. However, they have similar size and skill sets.

I think Brothers could follow a similar path.;NFL Matches:  Minnesota, Green Bay, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, New York Giants, Cleveland, Washington, Dallas, Chicago, Miami and Denver",1
"Brandon Scherff/Gabe Jackson.  In some ways, Bergeron compares well to somewhere in between Scherff and Jackson. Bergeron is a beast of a run blocker like Scherff, but Bergeron does not protect the passer as well as Scherff does. In pass protection, Bergeron reminds me of Jackson.",1

Like Allen, Keisel was a strong bully on the field who was a tough run defender and able to contribute in the pass rush. Keisel (6-5, 285) and Allen are almost identical in size as well.

Hoyer (6-2, 216) and Stidham are similarly sized and similar as passers. Stidham is a better athlete, but overall, I think being a backup like Hoyer is the ceiling for Stidham in the NFL.;NFL Matches:  New York Giants, Jacksonville, Tampa Bay, Denver, Cincinnati, Miami, Washington, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles Chargers, New England",1
"Brian Kelly.  Elam compared well with former Buccaneers cornerback Brian Kelly. Like Elam, Kelly was a competitor who did a nice job of preventing separation while thriving as a zone corner. Kelly, hoewver, was very physical and a good tackler, while Elam must improve his tackling and physicality for the NFL. Kelly was a second-round pick in his draft class and was a key contributor to the 2002 Tampa Bay defense that was one of the top defenses in league history and led the franchise to a Super Bowl. In the NFL, Elam could be a corner similar to Kelly.",1

Dawson should be a mid-round pick, and he could easily end up being a solid contributor in his role.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, San Francisco, Buffalo, Los Angeles Rams, Los Angeles Chargers, Dallas, Minnesota, Cincinnati and New England ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Dawson in the 2018 NFL Draft.

"Brock Osweiler",1
"Brock Osweiler/Elvis Grbac.  There wasn’t a pro comparison who really jumped out at me for Rudolph, so I reached out to team scouts for their opinion. The two names I got back were Osweiler and Grbac. Regarding Osweiler, sources said they had similar arm strength and athleticism, although Osweiler is obviously taller. Osweiler was a second-round pick, and Rudolph also is likely to go in the second round. Grbac (6-5, 240) had a similar skill set to Rudolph.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, Denver, New York Giants, New York Jets, Washington, Arizona, Buffalo, Jacksonville, Los Angeles Chargers, New Orleans, Pittsburgh and New England ;There are a lot of quarterback-needy teams in the NFL, so that demand will help Rudolph to go on the second day of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Browns need a franchise quarterback, but given how high they are picking, they are likely to go with higher-rated signal-callers. The same goes for the Giants, Jets and Broncos, as they all could fill their quarterback need in the first round of the 2018 Draft, if not in free agency. Arizona also needs a long-term quarterback and is just outside of the top 10. Kirk Cousins should take away the need for one of these teams, and if the others value other position players more, they could target a quarterback like Rudolph on the second day. ;The Redskins could look to add a quarterback on Day 2 to groom behind Alex Smith. ;Even if Tyrod Taylor remains, Buffalo has a new regime that is likely to target a new starting quarterback in the 2018 NFL Draft. The Chargers have to start thinking of Philip Rivers eventual replacement, so they could consider Rudolph on Day 2. The Saints are in the same situation with Drew Brees, as are the Steelers with Ben Roethlisberger. All of those teams could think of Rudolph as a backup with the potential to grow into more than that.;Jacksonville could consider Rudolph as an option to turn to when they are done with Blake Bortles.

Jordan and Chubb aren’t blinding speed rushers, but they are tough and strong at the point of attack. With size, good hand usage, and quickness, they beat offensive tackles to get steady pressure on the quarterback. In the NFL, I think Chubb could be a defensive end similar to Jordan.;NFL Matches:  Indianapolis, New York Jets, Tampa Bay, Chicago, San Francisco and Oakland",1
"Cam Jordan.  In terms of playing style, Johnson reminds me of Jordan. Both are dangerous pass rushers who are physical in run defendse. Jordan was a late first-round pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, and Johnson could be a late first-rounder in the 2022 NFL Draft.",1
"Cam Jordan.  In terms of style of play, Basham reminds me of Jordan. Jordan (6-4, 287) and Basham are almost identical in size while being tough at the point of attack and possessing more speed than one would expect from a thick, heavy base end. Jordan was a late first-round pick in the 2011 NFL Draft and a steal for the Saints. Basham could go in the same range in the 2021 NFL Draft and end up being a very good value for his pro team.",1
"Cam Jordan.  In terms of style of play, Phillips reminds me of Jordan. Jordan (6-4, 287) is heavier, while Phillips is longer, but both have good motors and well-rounded play as run defenders and pass rushers. Similar to Jordan, Phillips has a lot of upside entering the NFL.",1
"Cam Jordan/DeForest Buckner.  As you can see from the scout’s comments above, team sources are comparing Walker to Jordan and Bucker. If Walker gains weight, he could slide inside to be an every-down tackle like Buckner. Given his current body, however, Walker probably is more of a Jordan-style end. Jordan was picked in the back half of the 2011 NFL Draft, while Buckner was a top-10 pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. Walker could end up as a top-10 selection this year in the 2022 NFL Draft.",1
"Cam Newton",1
"Cam Newton/Christian Hackenberg.  If things go well for Richardson, I think his ceiling would be a Cam Newton-type quarterback. Newton was a strong-armed dynamic athlete who could make plays other NFL quarterbacks could only dream of. Richardson makes those running plays and deep ball passes on occasion.",2
"Cam Robinson",2
"Cameron Erving",1
"Carl Davis.  Dexter reminds me of Davis coming out of Iowa. Each flashed a great skill set, but was inconsistent and did not play up to his ability. Davis was a third-round pick in 2015, and Dexter could go in that range this year during the 2023 NFL Draft.",1
"Carl Davis.  Wilson reminds me of Davis, who got a lot of media hype coming out of Iowa but was a limited player for the NFL. Davis (6-5, 320) and Wilson are similar in size but lacking the speed and athleticism to dangerous interior pass rushers. Davis has become a journeyman backup and was a third-round pick in 2015 by the Ravens and has played for six different teams so far. I could see Wilson being a similar caliber player in the NFL.",1
"Carl Lawson",2
"Carl Nassib",1
"Carl Nassib. Van Ness is a bit like Nassib coming out of Penn State. Both were strong and tough with some straight-line speed, but also stiff athletes who had some limitations.",1
"Carlos Dunlap",2
"Carlos Dunlap.  Sources have compared Charlton to Dunlap. Both are big, stout base ends who have the speed to turn the corner and rush the quarterback. Dunlap fell to the second round of his draft class because of some off-the-field concerns, but he was widely regarded as a first-round talent. Dunlap has turned into an excellent pro defender, and Charlton could be the same quality of player.;NFL Matches:  New York Jets, Cincinnati, New Orleans, Indianapolis, Baltimore, Washington, Detroit, Miami",1
"Carlos Hyde",1
"Carlos Hyde.  Moss reminds me of Hyde. Both had a mix of power, quickness, and the bell-cow ability to handle a big work load. I think Moss could be a better version of Hyde in the NFL.",1
"Carlos Rogers",1
"Carlos Watkins",1
"Carlton Davis.  Emerson reminds me of Davis coming out of Auburn. Both were big cornerbacks with length, strength, cover skills, and a dog mentality. Davis was a second-round pick, and Emerson could end up going in Round 2 of the 2022 NFL Draft.",1
"Carlton Davis. There are a lot of similarities between Davis and Surtain. Davis (6-1, 206) is almost identical in size and has some of the same strengths and limitations as Surtain. Both of them are big corners with instincts, ball skills, and a physical style of play. They also can have issues with twitchy speed receivers.",1
"Carson Palmer/Brandon Weeden.  If things go well for Hackenberg, I think his ceiling would be a Carson Palmer-type quarterback. Palmer is a strong-armed pocket passer who can excel with talent around him. That was Hackenberg as a freshman.",1
"Carson Palmer/Brock Osweiler",1
"Carson Wentz",1
"Carson Wentz.  It wasn’t easy to find a comparison for Herbert because he is a unique player with a rare skill set. Herbert has some similarities to Wentz, and team sources noted Herbert is bigger and stronger than Wentz, but they are pretty close in terms of their skill sets.",1
"Casey Hampton. Hampton had a great career with the Steelers after being the 19th-overall pick in the 2001 NFL Draft out of Texas. Hampton (6-1, 325) was a run stuffer and disruptor in the middle of Pittsburgh’s 3-4 defense. Billings is very similar, but I don’t think he will be as good as Hampton was in his NFL career. I think Billings will be more of a poor man’s Casey Hampton.;NFL Matches:  Buffalo, Washington, Houston, Cincinnati, Green Bay, Arizona, Seattle, Denver, New Orleans, Detroit and New Orleans",1
"Casey Hayward",2
"Cedric Benson",1
"Cedric Ogbuehi.  Jones reminds me of a less athletic version of Ogbuehi coming out of Texas A&M. Ogbuehi (6-5, 308) and Jones are almost identical in terms of size, athleticism and quickness but have a lack of strength and power.",1
"Chandler Jones",1
"Chandler Jones.  From a skill-set perspective, Ojabo kind of reminds me of Jones. Jones (6-5, 265) and Ojabo are similarly sized, and Ojabo will probably top out around Jones’ weight. Both are fast edge rushers with developed strength to defend the run. Jones went in the back of the first round in 2012, and Ojabo could’ve gone in that range before hi injury. If Ojabo turns into a good pro, I could see him being a similar style player to Jones.",1
"Chandler Jones.  In some ways, Garrett reminds me of a bigger version of Von Miller, but for the NFL a closer comparison could be Jones. Jones and Garrett are almost identical in size, and Jones (6-5, 265) is a pass-rushing demon. Jones is a speed rusher who has topped 11 sacks in three of the last four seasons. I could see Garrett being an edge defender similar to Jones, but even better.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, San Francisco, Chicago, Jacksonville and Tennessee",1
"Charles Clay",2
"Charles Gaines",1
"Charles James",1
"Charles Johnson.  Walker reminds me of a taller version of Johnson. Both are hard-charging pass-rushers who find a way to be effective despite not having elite skill sets. Johnson (6-2, 275) was a second-day pick, and Walker should go on Day 2 as well.;NFL Matches:  Dallas, Detroit, Miami, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, New York Jets, Cincinnati, New Orleans, Indianapolis, Baltimore, Washington and Tampa Bay",1
"Charles Leno.  Jones reminds me of Leno (6-4, 310). Leno may be slightly quicker, although Jones is a little stronger and nastier.",1
"Charlie Garner",1
"Charlie Heck",1
"Charone Peake",1
"Chase Daniel",4
"Chase Winovich.  Winovich (6-3, 250) was an undersized speed rusher coming out of Michigan, and Roche is nearly identical in size and possesses serious speed off the edge. Winovich was a third-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, and Roche could go around there in the 2021 NFL Draft.",1
"Chauncey Gardner-Johnson",1
"Chris Carson",1
"Chris Carson.  Pierce reminds me of Carson. Both have a mix of power, quickness, receiving ability, and the toughness to handle a big work load. Pierce could be a similar pro back to Carson.",1
"Chris Chester",1
"Chris Conley",1
"Chris Conte. Team sources have compared Davis to Chris Conte. Conte (6-2, 203) and Davis are almost identical in size, with both of them having limitations for the NFL. Conte managed to play eight season, but he was not very good for the Bears and Buccaneers. I could see Davis having a similar career.",1
"Chris Gamble. In the 2004 NFL Draft, Gamble was the 28th-overall pick. He was a quality corner for the Panthers, overall, and had a good career. Lattimore has comparable size to Gamble (6-1, 200), and their skill sets are similar in terms of possessing the size to matchup against big receivers and the speed to take on fast wideouts. Lattimore will go higher than Gamble did, but Gamble could end up with the better NFL career because of Lattimore’s durability factor. If Lattimore can stay on the field, I think he would be a corner comparable to Gamble.;NFL Matches:  San Francisco, Chicago, Tennessee, New York Jets, Buffalo, New Orleans, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Baltimore",1
"Chris Godwin  Olave reminds me of Godwin with his speed, smooth route-running, and polish as a receiver. Olave, however, could stand to fill out his frame to be more like Godwin, who is about 20 pounds heavier. If Olave pans out, he could be a receiver similar to Godwin.",1

"Chris Jones",1
"Chris Jones.  Barmore’s interior pass-rush ability looks comparable to Chris Jones’. Jones (6-6, 310) and Barmore are almost identical in size and have rare quickness and speed to get after the quarterback. Like Barmore, Jones had some raw elements to his game coming out of Mississippi State, which is why he slipped to the second round. Jones landed with the Chiefs, which did a great job developing him into one of the best interior defensive linemen in the NFL. Barmore is very similar to Jones in needing development but having big-time potential for the NFL.",1
"Chris Jones.  Bryan has a lot of similarities to Chris Jones. At Mississippi State, Jones flashed his impressive combination of size and speed, but wasn’t always consistently productive. That was the same for Bryan at Florida. Jones (6-6, 310) and Bryan are similarly sized to go along with surprising quickness and athleticism.;NFL Matches:  Tampa Bay, Washington, Arizona, Oakland, Los Angeles Chargers, Detroit, Buffalo, Atlanta, New Orleans and New England",1
"Chris Kemoeatu",1
"Chris Long",1
"Chris Myers. Jurgens reminds me of the former Texans center Chris Myers. Myers had a 10-year career, and in his prime, he was a Pro Bowl center in Gary Kubiak’s zone scheme, opening holes for Arian Foster. Like Jurgens, Myers (6-4, 286) lacked ideal weight and strength but made it up for it with quickness. In the NFL, Jurgens could end up being a center similar to Myers.",1
"Christian Benford",1
"Christian Kirk",1
"Christian McCaffrey.  Some scouts say Gainwell’s style of play is similar to McCaffrey, the best back in the NFL, because of his ability to be a playmaking running back or receiver. Gainwell probably will not be as good of a pro as McCaffrey, but Gainwell’s style of play at Memphis looked like McCaffrey in Carolina. Gainwell might be a poor-man’s McCaffrey in the NFL.",1

"Cliff Avril. Mafe reminds me of Avril (6-3, 260). They are almost identical in size and fast edge rushers who can hunt quarterbacks. Both players are light in the run game as well. Avril was a quality pass rusher over his solid NFL career, and if Mafe pans out, I could see him being a pro comparable to Avril.",1
"Cliff Avril. Spence reminds me of Avril (6-3, 260). They are similarly sized fast edge rushers who hunt quarterbacks. Both players are light in the run game though. Avril has been a quality pass-rusher over his eight seasons, and if Spence can stay out of trouble, I could see him being a pro comparable to Avril.;NFL Matches:  Tampa Bay, New York Giants, Detroit, Oakland, Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Jacksonville and Baltimore",1
"Cliff Avril. White reminds me of Avril (6-3, 260). They are almost identical in size and fast edge rushers to hunt quarterbacks. Both players are light in the run game. Avril was a quality pass rusher over a solid NFL career, and if White pans out, I could see him being a pro comparable to Avril.",1
"Clint Boling",1
"Clyde Edwards-Helaire.  Badie is reminiscent of Edwards-Helaire coming out of LSU. They are almost identical in size, and both were excellent receivers in college. They have some of the same limitations in height and length. As a pro, Badie could be a back similar to Edwards-Helaire.",1
"Cobie Durant.  Durant (5-11, 180) and Forbes are almost identical in size, and both have good ball skills. Durant was a fourth-round pick in part because he played at a small school. However, Durant had a nice rookie season for the Rams.",1
"Coby Fleener",1
"Coby Fleener.  As the source said above, Gesicki is very similar to Fleener. As a 33rd-overall pick, Fleener was one of the busted picks by former Colts general manager Ryan Grigson. Gesicki should be a third- or fourth-rounder in the 2018 NFL Draft, and thus the expectations should be more realistic for him to develop into a role player. He could definitely end up being a better version of Fleener.;NFL Matches:  Pittsburgh, Miami, Baltimore, Green Bay, New England, Jacksonville and Houston ;Pittsburgh needs a tight end upgrade and is in ‘win-now’ mode. Gesicki could give the Steelers a receiving weapon to use down the seam.",1
"Cody Barton",1

"Cody Kessler",2
"Cody Whitehair",1
"Cody Whitehair.  Johnson reminds some of Whitehair. Both are technicians with quality play strength, sufficient athleticism, enough quickness, and toughness. Whitehair was a second-round pick in 2016, and Johnson should go no lower than the second round in the 2022 NFL Draft.",1
"Cody Whitehair.  Typically, we don’t use rookies for the comparison. There are a ton of similarities between Lamp and Whitehair, however. They are almost identical in size, and both were left tackles in college yet had to move inside for the NFL. Whitehair had a quality rookie season at center for the Bears in 2016. I think Lamp would be at his best playing center in the NFL and could be a blocker comparable to Whitehair.;NFL Matches:  Jacksonville, Indianapolis, Baltimore, Detroit, Oakland, Cleveland, Denver, Minnesota, Seattle and San Diego",1

Barwin (6-4, 264) and Watt are similar size, too. In time, Watt’s playing weight will probably be closer to Barwin’s. Barwin was a second-round pick by the Texans in 2009, and Watt shouldn’t go any lower than Round 2 in the 2017 NFL Draft.

"D.J. Fluker.  Teams sources have compared Brown to Fluker. Fluker (6-5, 345) is not as tall as Brown, but both of them have a lot of power and a mean streak as run blockers. They each have limitations for taking on speed rushers that limit them for the NFL. However as a pro, I think Brown could be better than Fluker.;NFL Matches:  Jacksonville, New England, Philadelphia, Tampa Bay, Denver, Miami, Arizona, Cleveland, Baltimore, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Brown in the 2018 NFL Draft. The Jaguars’ offensive line could still get better and more talented. Brown could upgrade the Jacksonville line at right tackle over Jeremy Parnell. New England lost Nate Solder in free agency, so Brown could interest the organiztion to compete as a replacement. ;Philadelphia needs another tackle of the future to pair with Lane Johnson. Johnson could go to left tackle to replace aging veteran Jason Peters with Brown being the starting right tackle. Brown could make a lot of sense for the Eagles if they trade down from their first-round pick. ;Denver could use more offensive line help. They could bookend Garett Bolles with Brown on the right side. Tampa Bay probably will address more pressing needs, but they could use a right tackle of the future given the age of Demar Dotson. ;The Dolphins need help on the line, and they might not keep Ja’Wuan James for the long term. Miami could draft Brown in the second round and start him out at guard. If James isn’t in the long-term plans, then Brown could move to right tackle to form a tandem with Laremy Tunsil.",1
"D.J. Humphries",1
"D.J. Humphries.  Hudson reminds me of Humphries coming out of Florida, and they are nearly identical in terms of size and speed. Humphries was a top recruit who dealt with injuries in college and had limited experience entering the NFL. Like Hudson, Humphries showed a good skill set of athleticism, quickness and agility on the edge, but he was also a raw talent with some development needed to become a good pro. Many teams had Humphries (6-5, 307) graded in the second round, but Arizona took him late in the first round. Hudson is a bit more raw, shorter, and less developed, so could end up as a second-round pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. If Hudson pans out in the NFL, I could see his career and caliber of play mirroring Humphries’.",1
"D.J. Humphries. Jackson’s skill set, including a rare combination of size, quickness and athleticism reminds me of Humphries coming out of Florida. Humphries (6-5, 307) also needed to get stronger for the NFL, and while it took some time, he hass turned into a solid pro. In the NFL, I think Jackson will be a better version of Humphries if he lands with quality coaching.",1
"D.J. Humphries. Petit-Frere reminds me of Humphries coming out of Florida. Humphries (6-5, 307) was a very good athlete with upside, but who needed to get stronger and tougher for the NFL. It took some developmental time before Humphries emerged as a solid pro, but he was named a Pro Bowl alternate in 2021. Humphries was a late first-round pick in 2015, and Petit-Frere could be a late first-rounder in the 2022 NFL Draft.",1

They are thick-bodied nose tackles with surprising explosion at the point of attack. They are also almost identical in size and have similar limitations. Reader (6-3, 335) is turning into one of the top nose tackles in the NFL, and I think Settle could become a similar-caliber pro. The Texans outsmarted the league when they took Reader in the fifth round of the 2016 NFL Draft. Settle should go on the second day of the 2018 NFL Draft, and Reader should have been a second-day pick as well.;NFL Matches:  San Francisco, Oakland, Washington, Arizona, Oakland, Los Angeles Chargers, Detroit, Buffalo, Atlanta and New Orleans",1
"D.J. Swearinger.  Team sources have compared Abram to Swearinger, which makes sense. They have similar skill sets, are almost identical in size, and play the game similarly in terms of physical style. Swearinger (5-10, 205) has turned into one of the better safeties in the NFL since being a second-round pick by the Houston Texans in the 2013 NFL Draft. Abram does not make as many plays in coverage as Swearinger, but Abram is faster and a bit more athletic. In the NFL, I could see Abram being a safety of a similar caliber to Swearinger.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, Carolina, Tampa Bay, Green Bay, Kansas City, New England",1

Key was definitely a better college player, but both of them are dynamic pass-rushers when they are playing well. Hunter has 25.5 sacks in his three seasons, and I think Key could be a similarly productive pass-rusher. However, that all depends on if Key can avoid suspension and works hard to be the best he can be. Hunter was a third-round pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, and Key is probably going to be a second-day pick in the 2018 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Indianapolis, San Francisco, Oakland, Miami, Green Bay, Seattle, Detroit, Carolina, Tennessee, New Orleans, Kansas City and New England",1

"David Parry.  Similar to Phillips, Parry (6-2, 317) entered the NFL as nose tackle who had limitations as a pass-rusher. Parry was a fifth-round pick in the 2015 NFL Draft. Phillips could be a mid-rounder in the 2018 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Tampa Bay, Washington, Arizona, Oakland, Los Angeles Chargers, Detroit, Buffalo, Atlanta and New England",1
"David Terrell",1
"Davin Joseph.  Davis reminds me of Joseph during his good years with Tampa Bay. Joseph (6-3, 313) was a little better athlete and was a more polished pass protector, thus Joseph was a first-round pick. Davis will probably go on Day 2 in the 2021 NFL Draft. Joseph was not flawless in pass protection, however, and Davis could improve with pro coaching. I could see Davis having a good career at right guard like Joseph did.",1
"Davin Joseph. Green reminds me of a slightly better Joseph. Joseph (6-3, 313) went to multiple Pro Bowls after being a late first-round pick in the 2006 NFL Draft. I could see Green having a similar career in the NFL.",1
"Davis Webb",1
"Davon House. Awuzie reminds me of House. When there was talent around House in Green Bay, he was a solid corner with good size and enough speed to function. However when the supporting cast wasn’t good, lik in Jacksonville, House got picked on and allowed separation. That reminds me of Awuzie. House (6-0, 200) and Awuzie are identical in size. In the NFL, I think Awuzie will be a similar corner to House.;NFL Matches: Cleveland, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles Chargers, Buffalo, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Baltimore, Washington, Tennessee, Detroit, Miami, Oakland, Houston, Dallas and Green Bay",1
"Dawson Knox",1
"Dawson Knox. Kincaid compares well to Knox coming out of Ole Miss. Knox (6-4, 254) is a dangerous receiver who can get open and make some plays after the catch. Kincaid has a similar skill set and style of play.",1

"DeAndre Hopkins. Doctson’s game reminds me of Hopkins, but I don’t think Doctson will be as good as Hopkins in the NFL. Both receivers have some size to them, but they aren’t big separation wideouts. They make their living by making difficult, contested receptions over cornerbacks. In the NFL, I think Doctson could be a poor-man’s Hopkins. Hopkins was a late first-round pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, but he is one of the best players from that class. Doctson could also be a late first-rounder this year.;NFL Matches:  Los Angeles, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Baltimore, Carolina, New Orleans, Kansas City, San Diego, Washington, New York Giants, Detroit and Minnesota",1
"DeForest Buckner",1
"DeMarco Murray.  I reached out to team sources, and they said Murray was a good comparison for Ballage. The two have a similar running style with a surprising skill set of quickness in a bigger back with receiving ability. Murray was a third-round pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, and Ballage could also be a third-rounder. If Ballage pans out, he could be a back similar to Murray.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, Tampa Bay, New York Giants, New York Jets, Oakland, Detroit, San Francisco and Indianapolis ;There are a lot of teams that could consider taking Ballage on the second day or in the mid-rounds of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Browns could move on from Isaiah Crowell and could use another back in their offense. Ballage could make sense for one of their second-day picks.",1
"DeMarco Murray.  Sermon reminds me of Murray in that they have the potential to be really good backs in the right system. Murray (6-1, 220) and Sermon are similar in size with strength and quickness. Murray was a third-round pick out of Oklahoma, and Sermon could be a third-round pick this year.",1
"DeMarcus Lawrence.  One team source said that Polite did some things last fall that reminded them of Von Miller. However, I don’t think Polite will be as good as Miller in the NFL because of his off-the-field issues. I think the best case scenario would be Polite turning into a pro similar to Lawrence. Lawrence has had off-the-field issues and suspensions in the NFL, but he has turned into a very good player for the Cowboys. Both Polite and Lawrence have natural feel as dynamic speed rushers coming off the edge. Lawrence (6-3, 265) and Polite are almost identical in size and left college with similar skill sets. Lawrence was a second-day pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, and Polite could go on day 2 this year.;NFL Matches:  San Francisco, Oakland, Detroit, Atlanta, New York Giants, New York Jets, Washington, Carolina, Tennessee, Houston, New England, Kansas City",1
"DeMarcus Robinson",1
"DeMeco Ryans  The Eagles veteran linebacker is very similar to Ragland. Ryans is a physical, attacking linebacker who is a superb run defender. Ragland was the same type of player in college and should be in the NFL. Each of them was a star at Alabama, and in the NFL, I see Ragland being a linebacker of Ryan’s caliber. They both are leaders who are true captains. Ragland and Ryans are the emotional heart and soul of their defenses. In the NFL, I think Ragland will be as good as, or better than, Ryans has been with Houston and Philadelphia.

"DeSean Jackson",2
"DeSean Jackson, Dede Westbrook",2
"DeSean Jackson.  There are a lot of similarities between Jackson and Brown. Both have electric speed and are threats to score on any touch of the football. Both also are smaller receivers who have some limitations for the pro game. Jackson was a second-day pick in the 2008 NFL Draft, and I think Brown could go in the same range.;NFL Matches:  New York Jets, Buffalo, Miami, New England, Baltimore, Tennessee, Denver, Green Bay, San Francisco, Arizona, Dallas, Tampa Bay, New Orleans",1

"DeVante Parker",2
"DeVante Parker  Team sources have said Pickens reminds them of Parker when Parker has played well for the Dolphins. Parker was a first-round pick in 2015, and Pickens would have been a first-rounder if he had avoided injury in the spring of 2021.",1
"DeVante Parker, Kenny Golladay",1
"Deatrich Wise",1
"Dee Ford. I wouldn’t be surprised if Landry ends up being a pro similar to Ford. They are identical in size, and both were speed rushers in college who didn’t possess the size to translate to play as 4-3 defensive ends in the NFL. Ford (6-2, 252) has been a mild disappointment for the Chiefs. He had one season with 10 sacks, but in the other three years, he has not produced much. Ford was a late first-round pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, and Landry could go in the same range. In the NFL, I think Landry could turn into a player comparable to Ford.;NFL Matches:  Indianapolis, San Francisco, Oakland, Miami, Green Bay, Seattle, Detroit, Carolina, Tennessee, New Orleans and New England",1
"Deebo Samuel  Toney’s explosive playmaking ability and his dangerous run-after-the-catch skills remind me of Samuel coming out of South Carolina. Samuel was a high second-round pick – 36th overall – in the 2019 NFL Draft and has been a playmaker for the 49ers. Toney could go late in the first round or early in the second round during the 2021 Draft and end up as a playmaker comparable to Samuel in the NFL.",1
"Deion Jones",2
"Deion Jones. In the NFL, I think Queen could be similar to Jones. Jones (6-1, 222) is almost identical in size with great speed and athleticism. Jones was a second-round pick out of LSU in the 2016 NFL Draft, and Queen should not go any lower than the second round this year.",1
"Deion Jones. Pappoe could be a poor-man’s version of Jones in the NFL. Jones (6-1, 222) and Pappoe are almost very in size and possess plus speed and athleticism. In the 2016 NFL Draft, Jones was a second-round pick out of LSU, but Pappoe won’t go that high. He could be a mid-rounder in the 2023 NFL Draft who ends up being a sleeper-value pick.",1
"Delanie Walker",2
"Demarcus Robinson",3
"Demaryius Thomas. Sources have compared Davis to Thomas but a less-thick version of Thomas. That makes sense as both are bigger receivers with deceptive speed and excellent run-after-the catch skills. In the NFL, I could see Davis being a receiver who is similar to Thomas but maybe not quite as dynamic.;NFL Matches:  Buffalo, Philadelphia, Tennessee, Tampa Bay, Kansas City, Baltimore, Dallas, New Orleans, San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles Rams",1
"Denard Robinson",1
"Denico Autry.  Kancey reminds me of Autry, but a shorter version. Autry (6-5, 285) has issues holding up as a run defender but is a dangerous interior pass rusher despite being light for a NFL defensive tackle. If Kancey can stick in the pros, he could be a dangerous interior rusher similar to Autry.",1
"Denico Autry.  Odighizuwa is like a shorter version of Autry. Autry (6-5, 285) has issues holding up as a run defender but is a dangerous interior pass rusher while being light for a NFL defensive tackle.

"Deone Buccanon. Buccanon (6-1, 211) and Hufanga are almost identical in size and possess a similar physical style of play. Both have pass-coverage limitations for the NFL. Buccanon was a huge reach and bust for Arizona Cardinals general manager Steve Keim as a first-round pick, but Buccanon has managed to stick in the NFL as a rotational backup. Hufanga could follow a similar track if he can stay healthy.",1
"Derek Anderson.  In terms of skill set and playing style, McKee is reminiscent of Anderson. They are almost identical in size with capable arms and pocket passers. Anderson was more of a backup, and I could see McKee being similar in the NFL.",1
"Derek Barnett",2
"Derek Carr",2
"Derek Carr/Jay Cutler.  There are a lot of comparisons for Mahomes. On NFL Network, they consistently compare Mahomes to Cutler because they are both big-armed gunslingers who have decision-making issues. ;Others have compared Mahomes to Johnny Manziel, Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers. I can definitely see the comparison to that trio because Mahomes is like them with the ability to ad lib. All of them would take a play with nothing open, move around, and then make a big throw downfield. They also can throw from a variety of platforms. Like Rodgers and Favre, Mahomes has a big arm. ;I have heard some scouts compare Mahomes to Carr, and there are a lot of similarities between the two. They both have powerful arms, mobility, accuracy and toughness. Carr also came from a college spread offense at Fresno State similar to the one that Mahomes ran at Texas Tech. Like Carr, Mahomes also grew up with pro athletes in the family. I could see Mahomes being an NFL quarterback comparable to Carr. So much of whether Mahomes pans out, however, will be determined by the team and coaching staff that drafts him. He also will have to work hard to learn his NFL offense coming from a college gimmick offense that won’t correlate well to the pros. Carr was able to overcome that issue, and the question is if Mahomes has that ability.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, San Francisco, Chicago, New Orleans, Los Angeles Chargers, Arizona, Houston, Kansas City, New York Giants and Pittsburgh ;There are a lot of quarterback-needy teams in the NFL, and that will help Mahomes’ chances of moving up draft boards. Obviously, the Browns are in dire need of a solution to their quarterback quandary. Cleveland also is loaded with draft picks, including two in the first round, two in the second and one in the third. Mahomes could be a candidate for the Browns at pick No. 33.",1
"Derek Rivers",1
"Derek Wolfe.  Epenesa reminds me of Derek Wolfe coming out of Cincinnati. Both are tough at the point of attack to set the edge and are solid run defenders. As pro, I could see Epenesa being like Wolfe as a contributor in the pass rush, but not being an elite sack producer. Wolfe (6-5, 285) and Epenesa are similar size with length. If he’s drafted for a 3-4, Epenesa could gain 10 pounds and top out like Wolfe. Wolfe has been a good five-technique during his career and I think Epenesa will be as well.",1
"Derek Wolfe.  In conversations with scouts, they have compared Wormley to the Chiefs’ Chris Jones, but not as fast or athletic as Jones. Jones just finished his rookie season, so for another comparison, Wolfe would fit. Both Wolfe and Wormley are physical defenders who are tough to set the edge and can contribute some pass rush. They won’t be double-digit sack edge rushers, but they are very solid defenders who are good starters and help in both phases. It wouldn’t surprise me if Wormley is similar to Wolfe in the NFL.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, New York Giants, Dallas, Atlanta, New England, New Orleans, Detroit, Washington, Cincinnati, Arizona, Seattle and Denver",1
"Derrick Brooks.  I don’t like to pick Hall of Famers for comparisons because it isn’t fair to the prospect, but when watching Jack, Brooks comes to mind. The reason for that is the “once in a decade” pass-coverage skills, the ability to run sideline-to-sideline, and the rare athleticism. Nobody can’t expect Jack to be as good as Brooks, but I think that Jack will be a similar style linebacker in the NFL.;NFL Matches:  San Diego, Dallas, Baltimore, San Francisco, Philadelphia and New York Giants",1
"Derrick Henry",2
"Derrick Johnson.  Sources have compared Cunningham to Johnson, which makes a lot of sense. Johnson (6-3, 242) and Cunningham have the same build while both being instinctive linebackers who have a serious presence in the middle of the field. Johnson was a first-round pick out of Texas. In the NFL, I could see Cunningham being a linebacker similar to Johnson, although maybe not quite as good.;NFL Matches:  Miami, Detroit, New York Giants, Houston, Indianapolis, Green Bay, Buffalo, Los Angeles Chargers, Oakland, Denver, Kansas City, Cincinnati, San Francisco and Arizona",1
"Derrick Morgan",3
"Derrick Morgan.  Ferrell reminds me of Morgan coming out of Georgia Tech. Morgan (6-4, 261) is a well-rounded defender who is a solid, but not prolific, pass-rusher while being a dependable run defender. Morgan was a mid-first-round pick in the 2010 NFL Draft, and Ferrell could go in the same range this year.;NFL Matches:  Miami, Atlanta, Washington, Carolina, Tennessee, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, Indianapolis, Kansas City, New England",1
"Derrick Morgan.  Tryon kind of reminds me of Morgan. Both were solid edge rushers with solid skill sets. Morgan (6-4, 261) had more development and a more extensive body of work at Georgia Tech, so that helped him to be a first-round pick of the 2010 NFL Draft. Being a bit more raw and underdeveloped, Tryon should end up as an early-rounder in the 2021 NFL Draft. If he had produced another good year at Washington, he could have been a steady mid- to late first-rounder, like Morgan.",1
"Derrick Morgan. Morgan (6-4, 261) and Hubbard are similar in their sizes and skill sets. Morgan has been a solid, sturdy edge defender for the Titans since being a first-round pick in the 2010 NFL Draft – 16th overall. Generally, Morgan has around six sacks per year while contributing in the ground game as well as the pass rush. Morgan has never set the league on fire, but he has been a steady player. In the NFL, I think Hubbard will have a similar career and impact for his pro defense.;NFL Matches:  Indianapolis, San Francisco, Oakland, Miami, Green Bay, Seattle, Detroit, Carolina, Tennessee, New Orleans and New England",1
"Derwin James",1
"Derwin James.  Johnson reminds me of a smaller version of James. If Johnson can stay healthy and is used in the right role, I think he could have a big-time presence and be a valuable defender like James.",2
"Deshaun Watson/Dak Prescott. Some team sources say Fields is built like a thicker Deshaun Watson, and others say he has a build like Dak Prescott. Many forget that Watson had some uneven performances in his final year of college. I think Fields could be similar NFL quarterback to Watson, while some team sources comped Fields to Prescott.",1
"Desmond King",2
"Devin Bush",1
"Devin Duvernay",1
"Devin Funchess.  Team sources have compared Harry to Devin Funchess, which makes a lot of sense. Harry isn’t quite as tall as Funchess (6-4, 225), but both are big receivers who are size mismatches and threats to make catches over defensive backs. Funchess was a second-round pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, and Harry is a likely second-round pick this year. I think Harry will be an NFL receiver who is of a comparable caliber to Funchess. Some sources have also compared Harry to Laquon Treadwell.;NFL Matches:  Buffalo, Miami, New England, Baltimore, Denver, San Francisco, Arizona, Dallas, New Orleans, Tampa Bay, Indianapolis, Oakland",1
"Devin Singletary",2
"Devin Taylor.  Sources from multiple teams independently compared Kpassagnon to Taylor, which makes a lot of sense. Taylor (6-7, 275) and Kpassagnon are nearly identical in size. Both have great length with some athleticism. Taylor may not be as stiff as Kpassagnon, but Kpassagnon could be faster and stronger at the point of attack. In the NFL, Kpassagnon could be a defender similar to Taylor.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, New York Giants, Dallas, Atlanta, New England, New Orleans, Detroit, Washington, Cincinnati, Arizona, Seattle and Denver",1
"Devonta Freeman",1
"Devonta Freeman.  Dobbins reminds me of a taller and slightly bigger version of Freeman. Freeman was a second-day pick coming out of Florida State, and Dobbins could go on Day 2 in the 2020 NFL Draft.",1
"Devontae Booker",1
"Devontae Booker.  Rountree’s running style reminds me of Booker. Booker (5-11, 219) and Rountree are almost identical in size. Booker is a little faster, while Rountree is tougher. Booker was a fourth-round pick in 2016, and Rountree could go in the same range this year.",1
"Dexter McCluster",1
"Dion Dawkins",2
"Dion Jordan. Carter reminds me of Dion Jordan, although Jordan (6-6, 275) didn’t weigh as much coming out of Oregon. Carter and Jordan both were fast and athletic, possessing length and a ton of natural talent for college. Jordan never lived up to his potential and was a massive bust for the Dolphins after being the third-overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft. Carter won’t go that high, but his inconsistent play could lead to him being a disappointment in the NFL.;NFL Matches:  Tennessee, New England, New York Giants, San Francisco, Oakland, Miami, Green Bay, Seattle, Detroit and Carolina ;There are a lot of teams that could target Carter in the 2018 NFL Draft. This is a weak edge-rushing class, and that is a premium position in the NFL, so Carter could have plenty of teams hoping to land him. With his ability to fit any scheme and be an edge rusher, Carter will be in demand. ;The Titans need a young edge rusher. Their pass rush needs to be improved, and Carter could fit as an outside linebacker in Mike Vrabel’s 3-4 defense. Derrick Morgan and Brian Orakpo are aging and are nearing the end of their contracts. Carter would be a fit in Tennessee. New England also needs more young talent on the edge of its defense. Carter could make sense for one of the Patriots’ second-round picks. ;San Francisco 49ers general manager John Lynch has stated the team needs more edge-rushing talent. Carter could replace the short-term acquisition of Elvis Dumervil. Staying in the Bay area, the Raiders badly need more front seven talent. Carter could be an option for Oakland as an edge rusher to rotate with Khalil Mack and Bruce Irvin. Last year, sources with the Raiders felt that Mack and Irvin were forced to play too many snaps. Oakland needs another rusher to rotate for optimum production. ;The Dolphins could consider Carter in the first round, as they could use an end to go across from Charles Harris. Green Bay also could use more edge talent, and Carter would give the Packers some size and length at outside linebacker. Carter would make sense for Green Bay on the second day. ;Seattle could be a possibility for Carter if it is able to get a second-day pick. Michael Bennett and/or Cliff Avril could be nearing the end of their time with the Seahawks. Carter could make sense for Seattle as a long-term replacement. ;The Lions need an edge pass-rusher to go across from Ziggy Ansah. Carter could be a fit who gives Detroit more versatility. Carolina can’t count on Julius Peppers playing much longer, and Carter would make sense as his understudy.",1

"Domanick Williams",1
"Dominique Alexander",1
"Dominique Easley.  The media have jumped all over themselves comparing Oliver to Aaron Donald, but team sources think that comparison is flawed. Sources say that Oliver is not Donald, and that such a comparison is off because Oliver doesn’t have nearly the same strength as Donald. Donald has great strength, while Oliver lacks it. Sources say Oliver is a lot lighter than Donald, and as a result they are different players. ;“He is not the same guy as Donald,” said one source. “He is more comparable to a Dominique Easley. [Oliver is] disruptive, twitchy, and can do a lot of positive things, so that is why people are eager to compare him to Donald because they both have surprising speed. But Oliver is not Donald. Donald is extremely strong, and you could see that at the Senior Bowl when he was tossing guys around. Oliver has issues with mass and problems with double teams that Donald does not. [Oliver’s] lateral anchor is a problem.” ;Easley was an explosive and undersized defensive tackle coming out of Florida. Off-the-field issues have held him back in his career, but entering the NFL, Easley (6-2, 270) was a fast interior rusher with excellent athleticism but lacking size. Oliver has similar size and skill set to Easley.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, Tampa Bay, New York Giants, Detroit, Buffalo, Miami, Atlanta, Minnesota, Tennessee",1
"Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie",3
"Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.  Williams and Rodgers-Cromartie have some similarities as they are both athletic cornerbacks with length, a lean frame, and limited play strength. Rodgers-Cromartie was a first-round pick, and Williams probably will be one in the 2019 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Denver, Washington, Carolina, Cleveland, Tennessee, Pittsburgh, Houston, Oakland, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, New York Giants,",1
"Donnel Pumphrey",1
"Donovan McNabb.  Prescott has seen a lot of comparison made to Tim Tebow because they both played in Dan Mullen’s offense. Some have compared him to Russell Wilson, but in my opinion, McNabb is the most similar. Both are quarterbacks with strong arms, mobility, shorter-thick frames, and needing work as pocket passers entering the NFL. Obviously, Prescott won’t be drafted as early as McNabb was when he was the second-overall pick in the 1999 NFL Draft. But if Prescott improves and pans out, he could be a signal-caller with a playing style similar to McNabb.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, Dallas, San Francisco, New York Jets, Buffalo and Denver",1
"Donovan Peoples-Jones",1
"Donovan Smith",2
"Donovan Smith. Walker reminds me of Smith coming out of Penn State. Smith had some growing pains in pass protection, but he emerged as a steady and dependable left tackle in the NFL. Walker has that potential. If he works hard and gets quality coaching like Smith, Walker could turn into a similar-caliber left tackle.",1
"Dontari Poe",1
"Dontari Poe.  Poe (6-3, 346) is a similar size to Lawrence, and both have some freaky speed with athleticism for such a big nose tackle. Like Poe, Lawrence has had some excellent years and then other seasons in which his production was really down. Poe was a first-round pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, and Lawrence could be a first-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, Buffalo, Miami, Indianapolis, Minnesota, Green Bay, Los Angeles Chargers, Kansas City",1
"Dontari Poe.  Team sources said Poe was a comparison they saw for Smith, which makes sense. Both are heavy nose tackles who are tough against the run but don’t offer much interior pass rush.",1
"Donte Jackson",1
"Donte Jackson.  Turner’s combination of small size and elite speed is similar to Jackson’s, but Turner is more like a poor man’s Jackson. Turner has more stiffness and is tighter than the uber-fluid Jackson. Also, both can have issues with big receivers, but Jackson (5-10, 180) is more sound in coverage – even though he is a gambler at times. In the NFL, I could see Turner being a lesser version of Jackson.",1
"Donte Moncrief",1
"Dontrelle Inman",1
"Dont’a Hightower.  Parsons’s skill set, strength, athleticism and ability to cause havoc in the backfield are reminiscent of Hightower. Hightower was a first-round pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, and Parsons should end up as top-20 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft.",1
"Dont’a Hightower.  Sewell compares well with Hightower (6-3, 260) as both are large heavy linebackers. Hightower wasn’t the same player after sitting out 2020 because he got too heavy, which slowed him down. Sewell looked the like that in 2022. If Sewell drops weight, he could be more like the version of Hightower who went to Pro Bowls in 2016 and 2019.",1
"Doug Baldwin.  Miller’s gritty style of play with quickness, route-running, hands, and tenacity remind me of Baldwin. Baldwin (5-10, 192) went undrafted, but has turned into an excellent pro receiver. Miller will probably go on Day 2, but I could see him being an overachiever in the NFL similar to Baldwin.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, San Francisco, New Orleans, Dallas, Denver, Washington, Arizona, Buffalo, Baltimore and Jacksonville ;There are a lot of teams that could be in the market for a wide receiver upgrade on the second day of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Browns need more receiving talent for their offense even with Jarvis Landry being signed to a long-term deal. They can’t count on Josh Gordon to stay on the field, and Corey Coleman hasn’t panned out for them yet. With their second-round picks and third-rounder, the Browns could consider a receiver like Miller.",1

"Doug Martin, Josh Jacobs",1
"Doug Martin.  Harris’ running style and versatility remind me of Martin. Both backs have a thick build with quickness but not great speed. They also can contribute as a receivers. In the NFL, I could see Harris being a back of similar caliber to Martin.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, Miami, Washington, Carolina, Houston, Kansas City, Philadelphia ;There are a few teams that could consider taking Harris on the second day of the 2019 NFL Draft. Perhaps the highest that Harris could hope to go would be to Oakland with 34th-overall pick as the Raiders need a running back of the future. Harris would be a good scheme fit for Jon Gruden. ;Miami needs to replace Frank Gore, and Harris could form an excellent tandem with the brittle Kenyan Drake.",1

"Dre Kirkpatrick",2
"Dre Kirkpatrick. Porter reminds me of Kirkpatrick. They are identical in size, with Kirkpatrick (6-2, 190) having an excellent skill set of height, length and athleticism.

In the NFL, Porter could end up being a good cover corner like Kirkpatrick, but not a game changer.",1

"Duane Brown.  Brown and McGlinchey are very similar. They are both plus run blockers who also can be solid in pass protection. While they are generally good in protection, they aren’t shut-down left tackles and will give up some pressures and sacks against good rushers from time to time, with plenty of wins mixed in against those rushers as well. Both Brown and McGlinchey are assets in the run game and are better run blockers than typical left tackles. Brown was a late first-round pick, and McGlinchey could go in the middle to back portion for the first round as well.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, Tampa Bay, Denver, Miami, Arizona, Baltimore, Seattle, Cincinnati, Jacksonville and Philadelphia ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for McGlinchey in the 2018 NFL Draft. Early in the first round, there are a few teams that could shock the league by taking McGlinchey higher than expected. Joe Thomas retired, and the Browns will need a new starter at left tackle, so it could be possible that Cleveland would think of McGlinchey with the fourth-overall pick. One pick later, Denver could use more offensive line help. They could move Garett Bolles to the right side and really improve their offensive line with McGlinchey. Tampa Bay probably will address more pressing needs, but the team could use a left tackle upgrade. If the Bucs took McGlinchey, they could move Donovan Smith to right tackle or guard. ;The Dolphins need help on the line and might not keep Ja’Wuan James for the long term. Miami could draft McGlinchey in the first round and start him out at guard. If James isn’t in the long-term plans, then McGlinchey could move to right tackle to form a tandem with Laremy Tunsil.",1
"Duane Brown.  Some sources have compared Christian to Duane Brown coming out of Virginia Tech in 2008. Brown (6-4, 305) was a converted tight end who was still learning left tackle and had rough start to his pro career before developing into a Pro Bowler and franchise left tackle. Brown and Christian are nearly identical in size with athleticism. Christian’s career could follow a similar path if he works hard and gets good coaching. Brown was a very astute first-round pick by the Houston Texans in the 2008 NFL Draft. Christian will go much lower but has similar upside entering the NFL.;NFL Matches:  Jacksonville, New England, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Denver, Miami, Arizona, Baltimore, Cincinnati and Houston ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Christian in the 2018 NFL Draft. He could find a home with one of the playoff teams. The Jaguars’ offensive line could still get better and more talented. Christian could compete for the Jacksonville line at right tackle to replace Jeremy Parnell. New England lost Nate Solder in free agency and could interest the team as a replacement. ;Philadelphia needs another tackle of the future to pair with Lane Johnson. Johnson could go to left tackle to replace aging veteran Jason Peters with Christian being the starting right tackle. ;Joe Thomas retired, leaving the Browns in need ofa new starter at left tackle. It could be possible that Cleveland would think of Christian with one of its second-day picks. ;Denver could use more offensive line help. The Broncos could bookend Garett Bolles with Christian on the right side. ;The Dolphins need help on the line and might not keep Ja’Wuan James for the long term.

"Duane Brown. Sources have compared Robinson to Duane Brown, Ryan Clady and Russell Okung. I think the Brown comparison makes a lot of sense. Brown is one of the better left tackles in the NFL, but isn’t a shutdown pass protector despite being an asset as a run blocker.

I think Leonard could have a similar solid pro career to Henderson.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, Dallas, Detroit, Minnesota, Pittsburgh, New England and Philadelphia ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Leonard in the 2018 NFL Draft.

"Ed Reed.  Reed is a future Hall of Famer, and I generally don’t like to use those players for comparison because it can create unfair expectations. However in terms of style of play, Hooker is a lot like Reed. Reed was a tremendous coverage safety for the Ravens and a tremendous weapon in the deep part of the field. He produced a lot of interceptions and was phenomenal at returning them. Hooker is a taller, longer version of Reed (5-11, 205). In the NFL, I could see Hooker being a defender similar to Reed.;NFL Matches:  Tennessee, Jacksonville, Los Angeles Chargers, Carolina, Cincinnati, Buffalo, New Orleans and Cleveland",1

Jackson was a ballhawk and playmaker at Alabama who slid in the draft because of skill-set limitations and injuries with the Crimson Tide. However, Jackson has been an excellent safety for Chicago.

Justin Reid is a little bit smaller than his older brother Eric, but both of them are quality athletes with a combination of size, speed and intelligence. Eric Reid had an excellent debut with the 49ers when he was on a loaded defense, but he didn’t become a star in the NFL and is a solid, but unspectacular safety, who can contribute in pass coverage as well as run defense. Justin Reid will probably become a similar player in the NFL.;NFL Matches:  Los Angeles Chargers, Dallas, Carolina, Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, Cincinnati, Washington, Tennessee and New England ;In the second round of the 2018 NFL Draft, there are a lot of potential landing spots for Reid. The Colts have a trio of second-round picks, and Reid could form a talented young tandem with Malik Hooker. ;Tampa Bay could use a safety upgrade next to Justin Evans. Reid could be a nice addition to improve one of the more vulnerable pass defenses in the NFL. ;There has been some talk of the Patriots drafting a safety in the early rounds of the 2018 NFL Draft, and Reid would be a nice fit in New England’s defense.

Buffalo could consider Nelson as the team has to find a replacement for Ronald Darby. The Vikings have to consider a replacement for Terrance Newman, while the Bengals could use a replacement for Adam Jones. Nelson could interest both Minnesota and Cincinnati. ;In the NFC South, the Saints have bigger needs, but they also might consider a corner if he’s the best player available, plus it would give them a partner to go with Marshon Lattimore. Nelson could be in play for the Saints if he gets to their third-round pick. Atlanta could use a cornerback to replace Jalen Collins. ;The Patriots could consider taking Nelson with one of their second-round picks. Malcolm Butler left in free agency, while Stephon Gilmore was disappointing in his first year in Foxborough. Philadelphia may not sign Darby to a long-term extension, and Nelson could be selected as a future replacement for him.",1

They have excellent lean with the ability to run behind their lines and are very tough to get on the ground. Gore is a downhill, hard-nosed runner who has gotten a lot of yards after contact in his NFL career. Chubb could be similar to the long-time veteran. ;Another similarity between these two is they had knee injuries in college that could have prevented them from being top-20 picks even though they possessed that level of skill set. Gore has had a great NFL career, but if he never had the injuries, he could have been even better. Chubb is in the same boat in that he has come back well from his knee injury but may never fully get back the speed and explosion that he had before getting hurt. NFL Matches:  Cleveland, New York Giants, New York Jets, Oakland, Detroit, San Francisco and Indianapolis ;There are a lot of teams that could consider taking Chubb in the early rounds of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Browns may move on from Isaiah Crowell and could use a feature back in their offense. If they don’t get Saquon Barkley, Chubb could make sense for one of their second-round picks.",1

"Jamaal Charles",1
"Jamaal Charles.  Jones’ slashing running style and his speed to rip off yards in chunks is reminiscent of Charles during his glory years with the Chiefs. Charles (5-11, 200) and Jones are almost identical in size as well. In the 2008 NFL Draft, Charles was a third-round pick out of Texas. The Texas native Jones is likely to go in the second or third round of the 2018 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, New York Giants, Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, Oakland, Washington, Detroit, San Francisco and Pittsburgh ;There are a lot of teams that could consider taking Jones in the early rounds of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Browns moved on from Isaiah Crowell and signed Carlos Hyde. If they don’t land Saquon Barkley in the first round, Jones would make sense for one of their second-round picks.",1
"Jamaal Charles.  There are two Jamaal Charles-type backs in this draft class with Stanford’s Christian McCaffrey being one and Kamara being the other. Charles (5-11, 199) and Kamara are almost identical in size. Both can run the ball between the tackles with the explosiveness to rip off yards in chunks. They are tremendous receivers out of the backfield with shifty moves in the open field. Like Charles, Kamara could be a three-down difference-maker in the NFL.;NFL Matches:  Indianapolis, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Tampa Bay, Green Bay, New York Giants, Detroit, New York Jets, Carolina, Minnesota ;There are a lot of teams that could take Kamara despite not having a need at the position because he is a play-maker who could have a huge impact at providing wins for his team. ;In the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft, there are a lot of teams that could consider taking a running back. Perhaps the highest Kamara could hope to go would be in the middle of Round 1. The Colts (14), Eagles (15), and Ravens (16) all need long-term starting running backs. Of those three, the Colts are probably the least likely to take a tailback because of their vast needs on the defensive side of the ball. Philadelphia with Doug Pederson’s offense would be a good fit for Kamara’s running and receiving skills. Baltimore has tried a few different runners, but needs a lead back to carry the ground game. Tampa Bay could consider taking Kamara given Doug Martin’s situation and uncertain future with the organization. ;However, going in the top 20 seems too high for Kamara. Being selected late in the first round by one of the playoff teams is more feasible. There are a lot of fits among the playoff teams for Kamara. In the NFC North, the Packers lost Eddie Lacy this offseason and will need a starting running back. Kamara would be a great scheme fit for Green Bay. The Lions had the 30th-ranked rushing offense in 2016 and haven’t had Ameer Abdullah panned out thus far. ;The Giants fielded the 29th-ranked rushing offense last season and badly need some talent in the backfield. A speedy and play-making back like Kamara would really diversify their offense. ;If Kamara slips to the second round, he shouldn’t have a long wait. The Jets have Matt Forte, but the skilled veteran is aging. Kamara could make a big difference for whomever is the Jets next starting quarterback following Josh McCown – perhaps Christian Hackenberg or Bryce Petty. ;Adding Kamara to Cam Newton could be a dynamic combination of running ability for the Panthers. Jonathan Stewart just turned 30 prior and has had durability throughout his career. If Kamara gets to the Panthers’ second-round pick, he could be too good to pass up. ;The Vikings need a replacement for Adrian Peterson, and Kamara would diversify their offense. Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Baltimore would all be prime candidates to select Kamara with a second-round pick – if he falls that far.",1
"Jamaal Charles.  There are two Jamaal Charles-type backs in this draft class; McCaffrey is one and Tennessee’s Alvin Kamara is the other.

Baltimore has tried a few different runners, but could consider an upgrade to go with Kenneth Dixon. ;Tampa Bay could consider taking McCaffrey given Doug Martin’s situation and uncertain future with the team. Assuming Martin gets released, the Buccaneers will need a starting running back, and McCaffrey could also be an excellent receiving option for Jameis Winston. McCaffrey’s passion for the game and football character are fitting with Winston and what the Buccaneers have drafted. ;There are a lot of fits among the playoff teams for McCaffrey. The Lions had the 30th-ranked rushing offense during the regular season, and Ameer Abdullah hasn’t panned out for them thus far. Staying in the NFC North, the Packers may not be able to re-sign Eddie Lacy and would need a starting running back. McCaffrey would be a great scheme fit for them. ;The Giants had the 29th-ranked rushing offense during the 2016 NFL season and badly need some talent in the backfield. A speedy, play-making back like McCaffrey would really diversify their offense. ;New England enjoyed a good season out of LeGarrette Blount, but the Patriots like to have variety in their backs. McCaffrey is a Patriots-style player with his versatility as a receiving back in their offense. He could do some of the things that Shane Vereen did for New England, except McCaffrey could do them better. McCaffrey’s attitude and gritty style seem like a Patriot as well. ;If McCaffrey slips to the second round of the 2017 NFL Draft, he shouldn’t have a long wait. The Jets signed Matt Forte, but the skilled veteran is aging. McCaffrey could make a big difference for whomever is the team’s young starting quarterback, whether it is Christian Hackenberg or Bryce Petty. ;Adding McCaffrey to Cam Newton could be a dynamic combination of running ability for the Panthers. Jonathan Stewart turns 30 prior to the 2017 NFL Draft and has suffered from durability issues throughout his career. If McCaffrey gets to the Panthers’ second-round pick, he could be too good to pass up. ;Lastly, it seems unlikely that McCaffrey would get to the Vikings’ second-round pick, but they might be willing to move up for him. Minnesota has two third-round picks to use to move higher if it wants, and the Vikings fielded the worst-ranked rushing offense in the NFL in 2016.",1

"Jamar Taylor.  Averett has some similarities to Taylor. Taylor (5-11, 192) has some quickness and athleticism, but he is prone to giving up plays. He also lacks ball skills as Taylor has only three interceptions in 64 career games with the Dolphins and Browns. Taylor was a second-day pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, and Averett should go in the same range.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, San Francisco, Green Bay, Los Angeles Chargers, Dallas, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Atlanta, New Orleans, Minnesota, New England, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Indianapolis and Houston ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Averett in the 2018 NFL Draft. Buffalo could consider Averett as it has to find a replacement for Ronald Darby. The Vikings have to consider a replacement for Terrance Newman, while the Bengals could use a replacement for Adam Jones. Averett could interest both Minnesota and Cincinnati. ;In the NFC South, the Saints have bigger needs, but they also might consider a corner if he’s the best player available, which would give them a partner to go with Marshon Lattimore. Averett could be in play for the Saints if he gets to their third-round pick. Atlanta, meanwhile, could use a cornerback to replace Jalen Collins. ;The Patriots could consider taking Averett with one of their second-round picks. Malcolm Butler left in free agency, while Stephon Gilmore was disappointing in his first year in Foxborough. Philadelphia may not sign Darby to a long-term extension, and Averett could be selected as a future replacement for him.",1
"Jameis Winston.  Some team sources have compared Levis to Jeff Driskel. Another player who Levis reminded me of was Winston. Both have arm talent, toughness and leadership.

Bradberry was a second-round pick, and Banks could be a second-rounder this year in the 2023 NFL Draft.",1
"James Carpenter. From a skill-set perspective, Hunt is similar to James Carpenter coming out of Alabama in 2011. Carpenter (6-5, 321) was a first-round pick, but he has not played up to his potential in the NFL because of intangibles. Hunt and Carpenter are almost identical in size with good feet and athleticism. Hunt could be a better version of Carpenter as a pro.",1

"Janoris Jenkins.  Team sources have compared Jackson to Jenkins, and it makes a lot of sense. Jenkins (5-10, 190) is a smaller corner, but he is very fast and is superb at running the route to prevent separation. Jackson is similar with how fast and athletic he is. Jenkins fell to the second round because of off-the-field concerns stemming from his time as a Florida Gator. Jackson could be a late first-round or early second-round pick.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, San Francisco, Green Bay, Los Angeles Chargers, Seattle, Dallas, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Atlanta, New Orleans, Minnesota, New England, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Indianapolis and Tampa Bay ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Jackson in the 2018 NFL Draft. In the first round, the Raiders and 49ers both could use more cornerback help. Going as a top-10 pick could be too high for Jackson, but if either team trades down, that organization could consider Jackson. ;Green Bay has used a lot of picks on cornerbacks, but it remains a position to potentially address for the Packers. Jackson could get consideration as a cover corner. In Los Angeles, the Chargers could use a cornerback to go with Casey Hayward.

New England lost Nate Solder in free agency, so Miller could interest the Patriots as a replacement. ;Philadelphia needs another tackle of the future to pair with Lane Johnson. Johnson could go to left tackle to replace aging veteran Jason Peters with Miller being the starting right tackle. Miller could make a lot of sense for the Eagles’ first-round pick. ;In Round 2, there are a lot of potential homes for Miller. Joe Thomas retired, and the Browns will need a new starter at left tackle, so it could be possible they would think of Miller with one of their second-round picks. A few picks later, Denver could use more offensive line help. The Broncos could bookend Garett Bolles with Miller on the right side. Tampa Bay probably will address more pressing needs, but the Bucs could use a left tackle upgrade.

"Joe Haden.  Hargreaves’ style of play reminds me of Joe Haden as a cover corner. Hargreaves doesn’t play as physically with receivers as Haden does despite Hargreaves being larger. Haden can give up some plays here and there, but overall, he has been dependable to run the route and prevent separation. Haden was a top 10-pick in the 2010 NFL Draft, and Hargreaves should also go in the top 25.;NFL Matches:  Jacksonville, Miami, Tampa Bay, Chicago, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Oakland, Indianapolis and Washington",1
"Joe Haden.  In speaking with team sources, they felt that Alexander was similar to Haden. Alexander’s skill set and playing style is reminiscent of Haden when he was coming out of Florida and during his good years with the Browns. Both are good cover corners who run the route to prevent separation, have good ball skills, and play bigger than their size. Haden has had durability issues in the NFL, and Alexander could have similar issues given his final season at Louisville.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, San Francisco, Green Bay, Los Angeles Chargers, Seattle, Dallas, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Atlanta, New Orleans, Minnesota, New England, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Indianapolis and Tampa Bay ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Alexander in the 2018 NFL Draft. In the first round, the Raiders and 49ers both could use more cornerback help. One would have thought that going as a top-10 pick could be too high for Alexander, but it might not be. Oakland has shown a lot of interest in Alexander. The team has a huge need at cornerback, and Alexander could form a dynamite tandem with Gareon Conley. General manager Reggie McKenzie took cornerback D.J. Hayden high in the first round of the 2013 NFL Draft, despite Hayden coming off a serious injury. However, final say-so for the Raiders’ pick is now determined by Jon Gruden, and he drafted generally durable players in the first round during his run in Tampa Bay. ;Green Bay has used a lot of picks on cornerbacks, but it remains a position to potentially address for the Packers. Alexander could get consideration as a cover corner. In Los Angeles, the Chargers could use a cornerback to go with Casey Hayward. Jason Verrett is nearing the end of his contract and has had durability issues, but Alexander’s size and injuries could scare off the Chargers after their experience with Verrett.",1
"Joe Haden.  Ward’s skill set reminds me of Haden (5-11, 195). Both are smaller for No. 1 corners but have the ability to run the route and prevent separation. Big receivers can be problematic for both cornerbacks. Haden was a top-10 pick in the 2010 NFL Draft, and Ward could go in the top-20 of the 2018 NFL Draft. NFL Matches:  Cleveland, Chicago, Oakland, Los Angeles Chargers, Dallas, Buffalo, Minnesota, Cincinnati, New England and Philadelphia ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Ward in the 2018 NFL Draft. In the top 10, the Browns have to upgrade their cornerback talent, and Ward could be in play to be a No. 1 corner for them with the fourth-overall pick. Ward would be a good scheme fit for the Bears. Oakland lost out on free agent cornerback Trumaine Johnson, so the Raiders could consider reuniting Ward with Gareon Conley.",1
"Joe Haden. Witherspoon reminds me somewhat of Haden. In college, both were superb competitors with smooth athleticism to run the route and prevent separation. Both also had good, but not elite, speed.",1
"Joe Haeg.  Radunz reminds me of another North Dakota State product in Haeg. Haeg (6-5, 298) is slightly taller and longer, but they are similar athletes. Haeg has been backup/fringe starter for the Colts and Buccaneers during his career. I think Radunz could be similar, although he would have a better shot at being a full-time starter and better pro if he plays left guard exclusively.",1
"Joe Hawley",1
"Joe Mixon.  Hall reminds me of a little shorter version of Mixon. Mixon was a fellow Big XII back who showed the ability to rip off touchdown runs on any carry and also was a good receiver. Mixon (6-1, 220) was a second-round pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, and Hall should go in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft.",1
"Joe Mixon.  In terms of running style, White reminds me of Mixon (6-1, 227). They are virtually identical in size with a combination of size, athleticism, quickness, strength and height. Mixon showed more receiving ability than White in college. Mixon mat be a bit faster as a runner, but White is a more powerful and physical.",1
"Joe Mixon.  McIntosh’s running style reminds me of a poor man’s Mixon (6-1, 227). They are virtually identical their combination of size, athleticism, quickness, strength and height. Mixon showed more receiving ability and elusiveness than McIntosh in college. Mixon may be a bit faster as a runner, while McIntosh is more powerful and physical.",1
"Joe Staley",2
"Joe Thuney. Some team sources said that Risner reminded them of Thuney coming out of N.C. State. Thuney (6-5, 308) has found a home at guard in the NFL, and he has been a rock-solid blocker for the Patriots since being a third-round pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. Thuney and Risner are almost identical in size with similar skill sets. Risner could turn into a solid pro like Thuney, and Risner also could be a second-day pick.;NFL Matches:  Arizona, San Francisco, New York Jets, Buffalo, Cleveland, Tampa Bay, Carolina, Philadelphia, Houston, Minnesota",1
"Joel Bitonio",4
"Joel Bitonio. Bitonio and Lindstrom are nearly identical in size with similar skill sets. Bitonio (6-4, 305) is a bit more athletic than Lindstrom, but both are tough blockers who are well balanced in the ground game and pass protection. Lindstrom is probably stronger than Bitonio was entering the NFL. Bitonio was a high a second-round pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, and Lindstrom could go in the same range this year.;NFL Matches:  Arizona, Buffalo, Denver, Tennessee, Atlanta, Tampa Bay, Carolina, Philadelphia, Minnesota",1
"Joel Heath",1
"Joey Bosa",2
"Joey Bosa.  Nick Bosa is very similar to his older brother. Joey is taller and, longer while Nick could be faster and more explosive.

"Joey Hunt",1
"Joey Porter",1
"John Brown  Atwell is similar to Brown. Brown (5-11, 178) is an undersized deep-threat receiver with serious speed. Atwell is even smaller than Brown, but Atwell is probably a little faster. Brown was a third-round pick in 2014, and Atwell could go on Day 2 of the 2021 NFL Draft. I could see Atwell being a solid pro wide receiver similar to Brown.",1
"John Brown/Hunter Renfrow.  Austin reminds me of a cross between Brown and Renfrow. Brown (5-11, 178) is undersized, but a deep-threat receiver with serious speed, and Austin is similar in that regard. Austin, however, is a better route-runner and more shifty on underneath routes than Brown, and in this aspect, Austin reminds me of Renfrow.",1
"John Franklin-Myers",3
"John Greco",2
"John Henderson.  Multiple team sources have compared Davis to Henderson. Henderson (6-7, 335) was a tall, mammoth nose tackle who was a tough run defender for the Jaguars and Raiders. Henderson went to a few Pro Bowls during his career and was an interior run-stuffing force. Davis could become a similar pro.",1

"Johnathan Joseph",2
"Johnathan Joseph. Conley reminds me of Joseph. Both are polished well-rounded cornerbacks who do everything well. The only real difference I see between the two is Joseph (5-11, 185) is a little twitchier in short areas while Conley is a little bigger. However, both are versatile corners who can play a variety of techniques. They have good ball skills and are adept at preventing separation with their cover skills. With the Texans, Joseph has been one of the better and most consistent corners in the NFL. He is a smooth cover corner who goes under the radar. Thus, Conley reminds me of him in a lot of different ways. Joseph was a first-round pick in the 2006 NFL Draft, and Conley should be a first-rounder in the 2017 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Buffalo, New Orleans, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Baltimore, Washington, Tennessee, Detroit, Miami, Oakland, Dallas and Green Bay",1
"Johnathan Joseph. There are a lot of similarities between Joseph (5-11, 188) and McCreary who are identical in size. Both are good man corners with the speed to prevent separation and enough strength to match up against bigger receivers. Joseph was the 24th-overall pick in the 2006 NFL Draft, and McCreary could get first-round consideration in the 2022 NFL Draft and should not go lower than Round 2. McCreary could turn into a good NFL starter comparable to Joseph.",1
"Johnny Manziel.  Manziel and Kelly have a lot in common. Both are short quarterbacks with quality arms, mobility and athleticism. They also have major off-the-field issues. Ultimately, I think Kelly’s behavior could lead to him being out of the NFL quickly, much like Manziel.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, San Francisco, Chicago, New Orleans, Arizona, Los Angeles Chargers and New York Giants ;There are a lot of quarterback-needy teams in the NFL. If Kelly were clean off the field, he probably would get drafted as high as the mid-rounds given the demand for the position. Obviously, the Browns are in dire need of a solution to their quarterback quandary. Cleveland also is loaded with draft picks, so Kelly could be in play for one of the organization’s picks on Day 3.",1

"Jonathan Babineaux.  Babineaux has had a very good career after being a second-round pick in the 2005 NFL Draft. He has been a fast disruptor at the point of attack with the ability to contribute to the pass rush from the inside. Babineaux (6-2, 300) and Adams are almost identical in size with real speed at the point of attack. If Adams develops, I could see him being a player similar to Babineaux in the NFL.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, San Francisco, Detroit, New Orleans, Los Angeles Chargers, Indianapolis, Denver, New York Giants, Oakland, Seattle, Dallas and Atlanta ;On the second day of the 2017 NFL Draft, there are a lot of fits for Adams. The Browns have a plethora of picks and could use a three-technique tackle for their 4-3 defense. The 49ers also could use that kind of interior defender to help upgrade their weak defense.",1
"Jonathan Babineaux.  Babineaux is aging, but he had a good run with the Falcons. At his best, Babineaux was a quick, disruptive defender who made his presence felt behind the line of scrimmage. At the Senior Bowl, Rankins’ game resembled Babineaux (6-2, 200), but the Atlanta defender was more consistent. They are almost identical in size and have similar combinations of quickness and strength. The Falcons selected Babineax (6-2, 300) in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft out of Iowa. Rankins is likely to go higher than that.;NFL Matches:  Detroit, New York Giants, Detroit, Oakland, New Orleans, Atlanta, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Arizona, Seattle and Denver",1
"Jonathan Babineaux.  There wasn’t a pro comparison that I really liked for Brantley, but Babineaux was probably the closest. At his best, Babineaux was a quick, disruptive defender who made his presence felt behind the line of scrimmage. Babineaux (6-2, 200) and Brantley are very similar in size and have special combinations of quickness and strength. The Falcons selected Babineax in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft out of Iowa. Brantley could go in that range.;NFL Matches:  Detroit, New York Giants, Oakland, Seattle, Dallas, Atlanta, Cleveland, San Francisco, Los Angeles Chargers, Indianapolis, Minnesota and Denver",1

"Jonathan Martin.  Johnson reminds me of Martin. Coming out of Stanford, Martin had an athletic skill set to develop into a starting tackle, but he needed to get stronger and play with more aggression.

"Jonathan Vilma.  Sources have compared Davis to Vilma, which makes a lot of sense. Vilma (6-1, 230) was a fast and instinctive linebacker who could do everything in the NFL. He was the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and three-time Pro Bowler while being a leader on the Saints’ 2009 Super Bowl Championship team.

Both are willing blockers, but limited because of their size. Reed also has had issues with injuries and concussions. That could be a problem for Engram in the NFL given the way he plays.

I believe that Washington will be similar with an ability to immediately contribute to putting heat on the quarterback, but not be as good as Short has become for Carolina. Both players have the speed to be impact three-techniques that fire past guards to get to the quarterback.

Denver or Tampa Bay could take Notre Dame guard Quenton Nelson in the first round. Whichever doesn’t land Nelson could target Wynn in the second round.;Cincinnati definitely needs to improve its offensive line, so Wynn could be in play for the team as the true replacement to Kevin Zeitler. The Bears also could consider looking to get a guard upgrade.",1
"Kelvin Beachum/Rodney Hudson. If Slater were to stay at offensive tackle, he could compare to Beachum or the Patriots’ Isaiah Wynn. Those three all the same size and have limitations for blocking on the edge in the NFL. If Slater is moved to the inside, I think he could be a center comparable to Hudson, who was an excellent athlete with quickness and agility. Slater could be a similar center to Hudson in the NFL.",1

"Kendall Fuller. Mitchell looks to compare well with Fuller coming out of Virginia Tech. Fuller (5-11, 198) was a gritty corner who some thought was an inside corner only. Mitchell and Fuller almost identical in size and in terms of style of play. I could see Mitchell being a similar caliber pro to Fuller.",1
"Kendall Wright",1
"Kendall Wright.  Wright is a talented receiver who hasn’t gotten off the ground in the NFL because of issues around him. Perhaps that will change in 2016 with Marcus Mariota in his second season. Coleman is virtually identical in size to Wright (5-11, 190), and both were prolific receivers at Baylor. Wright is a more special athlete than Coleman as Wright is faster, more explosive, more sudden, and much better after the catch. Coleman is similar to Wright, just lacking in those categories. However, Coleman might have a more productive career if he lands with a good team and quarterback. Wright was a selection in the back half of the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft, and Coleman could go in that range.;NFL Matches:  Atlanta, Houston, Minnesota, Kansas City, Cincinnati, Carolina, Cleveland and Baltimore",1

"Kenny Britt. Brown’s game is similar to Britt when Britt was playing well early in his career. They are similar in build, and Britt was a dangerous run-after-the-catch receiver.

"Kenny Britt. Treadwell’s game is similar to Britt when Britt was playing well early in his career. They are similar in size and Britt (6-3, 220) was a dangerous run-after-the-catch receiver. Britt could have had more speed than Treadwell, but Treadwell’s plays with more physicality. Britt was the 30th pick in the 2009 NFL Draft in part because of character concerns.

"Kenny Vaccaro. I could see Moehrig being a better version of Vaccaro in the NFL. Moehrig looks like he better ball skills and is more instinctive in coverage as a strong safety. They have similar skill sets in terms of size and speed, with Moehrig having a little more length. In the NFL, I think Moehrig will be better than Vaccaro even thought he won’t go as early as Vaccaro did, 15th overall in 2013 to New Orleans.",1

Dantzler and Johnson have a similar physical style of play with versatility in coverage. If Dantzler can stay healthy despite his slim build, he could be a better version of Johnson in the NFL.",1
"Kevin Johnson. The best cover corner on the Texans last year wasn’t A.J. Bouye, Kareem Jackson, or even Johnathan Joseph; it was Kevin Johnson. Johnson was playing at a Pro Bowl level before a foot injury ended his season after six games. The similarities between Jones and Johnson (6-0, 185) are uncanny. They are a almost identical in size. Both are tall, fast cover corners who are phenomenal at running the route to prevent separation. Johnson was the 16th-overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, and Jones would have been taken there if his Achilles injury didn’t happen right at his pro day.;NFL Matches:  San Francisco, Chicago, Tennessee, New York Jets, Buffalo, New Orleans, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Baltimore, Washington, Detroit, Houston, Pittsburgh, Green Bay and New England",1
"Kevin Johnson. There are a lot of similarities between Newsome and Johnson. Both were very talented cornerbacks with the ability to run the route and prevent separation. They displayed the speed to cover and very physical with how they threw their bodies around. Johnson was an excellent corner in 2015 and 2016 before injuries derailed his career. The injuries depleted his physical talent, leading to him not being the same player. ;Newsome is similar with excellent cover skills, but having major durability issues. If a player has a hard time staying healthy in college, it is tough to project that changing in the NFL with the bigger, stronger, faster competition to go along with the longer and more physically demanding season.",1

"Kirk Cousins.  Scouting sources have compared Falk to Cousins, which makes sense. They don’t have great skill sets or overpowering arms, but they are accurate rhythm throwers. Falk and Cousins are the same height and both have a thinner frame. Cousins was a fourth-round pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, and Falk could go in the same range this year.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, Denver, New York Giants, New York Jets, Washington, Arizona, Buffalo, Jacksonville, Los Angeles Chargers, New Orleans, Pittsburgh and New England ;There are a lot of quarterback-needy teams in the NFL, so that demand will help Falk. The Browns need a franchise quarterback, but given how high they are picking, they are likely to go with higher-rated signal-callers. The same goes for the Giants, Jets and Broncos, as they all could fill their quarterback need in the first round, if not free agency. Arizona also needs a long-term quarterback and is just outside of the top 10. Kirk Cousins should take away the need for one of these teams, and if the others value other position players more, they could target a quarterback like Falk in the mid-rounds while also signing a different veteran free agent. ;The Redskins, meanwhile, could look to add a quarterback in the mid-rounds to groom behind Alex Smith. ;Even if Tyrod Taylor remains, Buffalo has a new regime that is likely to target a new starting quarterback in the 2018 NFL Draft. The Chargers have to start thinking of Philip Rivers’ eventual replacement, so they could consider Falk as a mid-rounder. The Saints are in the same situation with Drew Brees, as are the Steelers with Ben Roethlisberger. All of those teams could think of Falk as a backup with the potential to grow into more than that.;Jacksonville could consider Falk as an option to turn to when it is done with Blake Bortles. The Patriots traded away Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett, so they could take Falk in the mid-rounds as a young backup to Tom Brady.",1

"Kony Ealy.  Right now, Green reminds me of a faster version of Ealy. Ealy (6-4, 275) and Green are identical in size. Green could gain weight and become an every-down defensive tackle in the NFL. If Green doesn’t, I think he will be an end similar to Ealy. Coming out of Missouri, Ealy was a late second-round pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, and Green could go in the same region.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, Tampa Bay, Washington, Arizona, Oakland, Los Angeles Chargers, Detroit, Buffalo, Atlanta and New England",1

In college, Van Noy was a prolific sacker of the quarterback, and in the NFL, he has turned into a well-rounded defender who can contribute in pass coverage as well as rush the quarterback. I think Chenal could follow a similar pattern as a pro. Van Noy was an early second-round pick – 40th overall – in the 2014 NFL Draft, and Chenal similarly could go on Day 2 of the 2022 NFL Draft.",1

"Kyle Van Noy.  Van Noy was a disappointment in Detroit, but has developed into a quality pro with the Patriots. Van Noy has the ability to rush off the edge and contribute dropping into pass coverage. Ximines and Van Noy (6-3, 250) are roughly the same size, and Ximines could end up at 250 pounds once he gains mass in a NFL strength and conditioning program. In the 2014 NFL Draft, Van Noy was a second-round pick, and Ximines could go in the second round this year.

I think Grant gets overlooked some playing at Central Florida, but in the NFL, I could see Grant being a safety that is a similar style player to Collins.",1
"Landon Collins. Harrison is very similar to former Alabama safety Landon Collins. Both are excellent run defenders who are good tacklers and hard hitters. They also have limitations for how they can be used in pass coverage. Collins was the 33rd-overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, and Harrison could go in the same area. In the NFL, I think Harrison will be a lesser version of Collins.;NFL Matches:  Los Angeles Chargers, Seattle, Dallas, Carolina, Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, San Francisco, Cincinnati and Washington ;In the back half of the first round, there are a few landing spots for Harrison. The Los Angeles Chargers are probably the highest that Harrison could hope to go. They have had a hole at safety since Eric Weddle departed in free agency, and Harrison would give them an enforcer on the back end of their defense. ;Seattle is starting to revamp of its great defense, and there has been a lot of rumors that the Seahawks could move on from Earl Thomas, plus Kam Chancellor’s playing future is in doubt. Harrison could be a replacement for Chancellor.",1

"Lavonte David.  The closest thing to Smith in the NFL is Bucs standout linebacker Lavonte David. Like David, Smith is a speed demon who flies around the field making tackles in the ground game while also being good in pass coverage. They each have size issues, but make up for it with great instincts and big-play ability. David was a second-round pick, and Smith also will be an early-rounder.

"LeGarrette Blount.  In terms of running style, Foreman reminds me of Blount. They are physical downhill backs who can handle a big work load. Both are very strong with the ability to run through tackles and pick up yards after contact. Foreman played heavier than he weighed in this offseason and was closer to Blount (6-0, 250). Teams had a second-round grade on Blount for the 2010 NFL Draft, but Blount went undrafted because of off-the-field issues. Foreman could easily be a second-round pick in the 2017 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Indianapolis, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Tampa Bay, Green Bay, New York Giants, Detroit, New York Jets, Carolina and Minnesota ;There are a lot of teams that could take Foreman. In the second round, there are a lot of organizations that could consider taking a running back. The Jets signed Matt Forte, but the skilled veteran is aging. Foreman could make a big difference for whomever is the Jets next starting quarterback after Josh McCown in Christian Hackenberg or Bryce Petty. ;Adding Foreman to Cam Newton could be a dynamic combination of running ability for the Panthers. Jonathan Stewart recently turned 30 and has had durability throughout his career. If Foreman gets to one of the Panthers’ second-round picks, he could be too good to pass up if they don’t take a running back in the first round. ;Perhaps the highest Foreman could hope to go would be in the middle of the second round. The Colts, Eagles and Ravens all need long-term starting running backs. Of those three teams, the Colts are probably the least likely to take a tailback because of the vast needs on the defensive side of the ball. Philadelphia with Doug Pederson’s offense might not be a good fit for Foreman’s lack of receiving skills. Baltimore has tried a few different runners, but need a lead back to carry its ground game. Tampa Bay could consider taking Foreman given Doug Martin’s situation and his uncertain future for the Bucs. ;In the NFC North, the Packers lost Eddie Lacy this offseason and will need a starting running back. Foreman would give Green Bay a physical presence to its offense. The Lions had the 30th-ranked rushing offense in 2016, and Ameer Abdullah hasn’t panned out thus far. The Vikings need a replacement for Adrian Peterson, and Foreman is a lot more talented than Latavius Murray. ;The Giants fielded the 29th-ranked rushing offense last season and badly need some talent in the backfield. Foreman would bring a physical presence to their offense.",1

McKelvin was a high first-round pick, and Hughes could be a mid- to late first-rounder.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, San Francisco, Green Bay, Los Angeles Chargers, Seattle, Dallas, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Atlanta, New Orleans, Minnesota, New England, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Indianapolis and Tampa Bay ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Hughes in the 2018 NFL Draft. In the first round, the Raiders and 49ers both could use more cornerback help. Going as a the top-10 pick could be too high for Hughes, but if either team trades down, it could consider Hughes. ;Green Bay has used a lot of picks on cornerbacks, but it remains a position to potentially address for the Packers. Hughes could get consideration as a cover corner. In Los Angeles, the Chargers could use a cornerback to go with Casey Hayward. Jason Verrett is nearing the end of his contract and has had durability issues.",1

He could find a home with one of the playoff teams. The Jaguars’ offensive line could still get better and more talented. Williams could compete for the Jacksonville line at right tackle to replace Jeremy Parnell. New England lost Nate Solder in free agency, so Williams could interest the Patriots as a replacement. ;Philadelphia needs another tackle of the future to pair with Lane Johnson. Johnson could go to left tackle to replace aging veteran Jason Peters with Williams being the starting right tackle. ;Joe Thomas retired, meaning the Browns will need a new starter at left tackle, so it could be possible that they would think of Williams with one of their second-day picks. ;Denver could use more offensive line help. The Broncos could book end Garett Bolles with Williams on the right side. ;The Dolphins need help on the line and might not keep Ja’Wuan James for the long term.

"Mackensie Alexander",3
"Mackensie Alexander.  Similar to Samuel, Alexander (5-10, 192) had some media hype but teams were lower on him. They are almost identical in size, and Alexander has been limited to being a slot corner because of his lack of height and speed. Samuel could follow a similar path in the NFL.",1
"Madieu Williams",1
"Malcolm Jenkins",1
"Malcom Floyd.  Floyd had a solid 12-year career for the Chargers as a size-mismatch weapon. Floyd (6-5, 225) was a large target and produced some seasons with impressive yardage and yards per catch – 19.4 in 2010, 19.9 in 2011-, despite being a No. 2 receiver for most of his career. If Ateman pans out in the NFL, I could see him being a receiver similar to Floyd.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, San Francisco, Chicago, Denver, Washington, Arizona, Buffalo, Baltimore, New Orleans and Jacksonville ;There are a lot of teams that could be in the market for a wide receiver upgrade in the 2018 NFL Draft. The Browns need more receiving talent for their offense. They can’t count on Josh Gordon to stay on the field, and Corey Coleman hasn’t panned out for them yet. The Browns could consider a receiver like Ateman on Day 2 or in the mid-rounds.",1
"Maliek Collins",2
"Maliek Collins.  Collins (6-2, 310) and Wyatt are almost identical in size. They both have speed and athleticism in a stumpy build with an ability to be disruptive. A lack of length hurts both players. In the NFL, I could see Wyatt being a defender similar to Collins.",1
"Maliek Collins.  Tufele’s style of play with speed and a shorter, thick build kind of reminds me of Collins coming out of Nebraska. Collins (6-2, 308) and Tufele are nearly identical in size and have a burst off the ball. Collins was a third-round pick in 2016, and Tufele could go in the same range this year.",1
"Malliciah Goodman",2
"Manny Lawson.  Some have compared Sweat to Jason Taylor, which makes some sense because they are nearly identical in size. It isn’t fair, however, to compare prospects to players in the Hall of Fame, as that can set unreasonable expectations. Another edge defender who has a similar skill set to Sweat was Lawson. Lawson had a solid career with the 49ers and Bills, but never was a prolific pass-rusher after being a first-round pick in the 2006 NFL Draft. I think Sweat will be a better version of Lawson (6-5, 240) and produce more in the sack department during his NFL career. Some team sources have compared Sweat to Lawson, and it makes sense as they are nearly the same size and possess similar skill sets.;NFL Matches:  Green Bay, Washington, Carolina, Tennessee, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Los Angeles Rams, New England",1
"Marcedes Lewis.  Washington compares well to Lewis. They are almost identical in size, and Lewis (6-6, 267) is a superb blocker. Both have some receiving ability, but they are not prolific at racking up catches. Lewis has had an extremely long NFL career, and Washington could as well because of his prolific blocking skills.",1
"Marcel Dareus.  Robinson’s playing style reminds me of Dareus. Both are thick, strong and athletic. Dareus (6-3, 331) is heavier than Robinson, but Robinson looked heavier during the seasons and probably dropped weight to run faster at the combine. Dareus was a high first-rounder because he was more consistent, but if Robinson can play at a more steady level, he could be an impact-generating defender at the point of attack similar to Dareus.;NFL Matches:  Baltimore, New Orleans, Detroit, New Orleans, Buffalo, Washington, Houston, Cincinnati, Arizona, Seattle and Denver",1
"Marcell Dareus",1
"Marcell Dareus.  Team sources have compared Payne to Dareus, and it is easy to see why. Both were freaky athletes as nose tackles for Alabama. Dareus (6-3, 331) and Payne are similar in size with rare combinations of speed and strength. Coming into the NFL, Dareus was a better pass-rusher than Payne and projected to doing more in the pass rush. Hence, Darues was a top-three pick while Payne will go lower than that. Still, I think Payne could end up having a more consistent career than the enigmatic Dareus.;NFL Matches:  Tampa Bay, San Francisco, Oakland, Washington, Arizona, Oakland, Los Angeles Chargers, Detroit, Buffalo, Atlanta, New Orleans and New England",1
"Marcell Harris",1
"Marcus Davenport",3
"Marcus Davenport.  Turner is similar to Davenport in being a raw defender with a good skill sets and upside. Turner will not get drafted as high as Davenport was, but some teams had Davenport graded on Day 2 and thought the Saints reached way too high on him. That has been proven true thus far. Turner could turn into a solid base end who is respectable but not a dominant sack producer.",1
"Marcus Maye.  Cook and Maye are very similar. Both are good free safeties who cover a lot of ground in the back end and are physical in run defense. They are instinctive defenders with versatility. After being drafted by the Jets, Maye has gone on to become one of the better safeties in the NFL. Maye (6-0, 210) and Cook are nearly identical in size and in their skill sets.",1
"Marcus Peters",2
"Marcus Peters. Both Stingley and Peters have good cover skills with size, speed and athleticism. They also have the ability to make big plays on the ball and play at an elite game-changing level. On the other hand, they also can have issues with consistency.",1
"Marcus Peters. Some team sources said Henderson reminded them of Peters. Both Henderson and Peters have good cover skills with the ability to make big plays on the ball.",1
"Marcus Williams",1
"Marcus Williams.  Team sources compared Williams to Thornihll, which makes a lot of sense. Both are free safeties who cover a lot of ground and have ball skills. They also have similar builds and issues as tacklers. Williams was a second-round pick, and Thornhill could go in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, Carolina, Tampa Bay, Green Bay, Kansas City, New England",1
"Margus Hunt",1
"Margus Hunt lite",2
"Mario Addison",1
"Mario Edwards",2
"Mario Edwards Jr.  Some team sources have compared Carter to Edwards, which makes sense. Edwards (6-3, 277) and Carter are almost identical in size while being tweener end/tackles. Edwards was a second-round pick, and Carter could go in Round 2 as well. As a pro, Carter could end up being a similar player to Edwards.",1
"Marion Barber",1
"Marion Barber III",1
"Mark Andrews",1
"Mark Andrews. Mayer’s receiving ability reminds me of Andrews, who is one of the better receiving tight ends in the NFL.",1
"Mark Brunell",1
"Mark Ingram.  Harris like a bigger version of Ingram. Both are physical backs with the quickness and the versatility to contribute as blockers or receivers. I could see Harris having an NFL career similar to Ingram’s.",1
"Mark Ingram.  In terms of running style, Hill reminds me of Ingram as a downhill violent runner who can pick up yards after contact. If Hill pans out in the NFL, I think he could be a running back similar to Ingram.",1
"Mark Ingram.  In terms of running style, Walker reminds me of Ingram as a downhill violent runner who can pick up yards after contact. Walker is nearly identical in size to Ingram (5-9, 215), and I could see Walker being a solid pro for a long time similar to Ingram.",1
"Mark Nzeocha",1
"Markus Golden",1
"Marlon Davidson",1
"Marlon Humphrey",1

"Marlon Mack",1
"Marquel Lee",1
"Marquess Wilson",1
"Marquis Haynes",1
"Marquis Haynes.  Browning could be a rotational edge rusher like Haynes in the NFL. Haynes has turned into a solid designated pass rusher who contributes as a backup. With some development, Browning could be a similar player, but he may have the skill set and upside to grow into a bigger role.",2
"Marquis Haynes. Haynes has flashed at time as a situational pass rusher during his pro career. Size limitations and being a tweener, however, have limited him to being a rotational backup. Bonitto could follow a similar path in the NFL.",1
"Marquise Brown",1
"Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown.  Multiple team sources compared Stevenson to a poor man’s version of Brown.",1
"Marquise “Hollywood” Brown.  Reagor reminds me of a thicker version of Hollywood Brown, who just had a good year for the Ravens. Both are big-play threats with elite speed.",1
"Marshall Faulk.  In terms of playing style, Cook reminds me of Faulk. Faulk was a fast, slashing back who was a threat to rip off a chunk run on any carry. In the Rams’ aerial offense, Faulk was a tremendous receiver, and Cook could be similar in the NFL. Faulk was a first-round pick, and Cook will be a first-rounder as well. In the NFL, I could see Cook being a back similar to Faulk, but it is unfair to expect any player to have a Hall of Fame career like Faulk did. Thus, think of this comparison as a style of player and not a forecast for Cook’s career. Other good comparisons for Cook include Jamaal Charles and LeSean McCoy.;NFL Matches:  New York Jets, Carolina, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Tampa Bay ;There are a lot of teams that could take Cook despite lacking a huge need at the position because he is a player who should make an immediate impact and also contributed significantly toward producing wins for his team. Among the first 20 picks of the 2017 NFL Draft, Cook has a lot of potential landing spots. ;Perhaps the highest that Cook could hope to go would be to the Jaguars because he is such a special talent. Tom Coughlin isn’t tied to the drafting of T.J. Yeldon or the signing of Chris Ivory. Additionally, having a weapon like Cook could help the Jaguars attempt to salvage Blake Bortles before he goes bust. ;The Jets signed Matt Forte before the 2016 season, but the skilled veteran is aging. Cook could make a big difference for whomever is the Jets’ young starting quarterback – whether it be Christian Hackenberg or Bryce Petty. ;A couple of picks later, adding Cook to Cam Newton could be an insane combination of running ability for the Panthers. Jonathan Stewart turns 30 prior to the 2017 NFL Draft, and he didn’t have a strong 2016 season for Carolina. Additionally, Stewart has dealt with durability issues throughout his career and there are rumors that he will get cut. ;The Colts were led by Frank Gore again on the ground in 2016, and the aging veteran isn’t a long-term option. Indianapolis needs to provide more support to Andrew Luck, and a running game with Cook would certainly make Luck’s job easier. ;Philadelphia fielded a weak rushing attack in 2016 and needs to give Carson Wentz more help in the form of a running game. Cook could be more valuable than any receiver who is available with the Eagles’ first-round pick of the 2017 NFL Draft. He would be a great fit in Doug Pederson’s offense.",1
"Marshawn Lynch, David Montgomery",1
"Marshawn Lynch.  Lynch (5-11, 215) and Taylor are nearly identical in size with both having power to run through tacklers and surprising speed for backs with their strong build. In the NFL, I could see Taylor being a back comparable to Lynch.",1
"Marshon Lattimore",1
"Marshon Lattimore.  Okudah reminds me of Lattimore at Ohio State. They have similar skill sets and almost identical measurements. In the NFL, I could see Okudah being a cornerback comparable to Lattimore.",1
"Martrell Spaight",1
"Marvin Austin",1
"Marvin Harrison",1
"Marvin Jones",2
"Marvin Jones. Jefferson and Jones (6-2, 198) are similar in size with athleticism, size and quickness. They aren’t overwhelmingly dominant in their skill set, but are effective with a nice combination of talents. In the NFL, I could see Jefferson being a wideout similar to Jones.",1
"Mason Foster.  Foster has been a solid NFL linebacker but is short on speed and athleticism. If Walker doesn’t get back to his pre-weight-gain form. I think he could be a linebacker comparable to Foster in the NFL.;NFL Matches:  Miami, Detroit, New York Giants, Houston, Indianapolis, Oakland, Denver, Kansas City, Cincinnati, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Arizona",1
"Mason Rudolph",1
"Matt Barkley.  I think Jones could end up being a similar quarterback to Barkley in the NFL. Some team sources agreed with the Barkley comparison, others said a shorter A.J. McCarron, and another suggested a stronger-armed Jake Fromm. Barkley (6-2, 234) and Jones are similar in size with some skill-set limitations.",1
"Matt Barkley.  In the NFL, I think Fromm could end up being a quarterback similar to Barkley. I mentioned that comparison to a general manager, and they said it was a good match. Barkley (6-2, 234) and Fromm are almost identical in size and have similar limitations in arm strength and athleticism.",1
"Matt Barkley.  In the NFL, I think Purdy could end up being a quarterback similar to Barkley. Barkley (6-2, 234) and Purdy are similar in size and have limitations that make them backup caliber.",1
"Matt Forte.  Team sources have told me that they feel Michel is a shorter version of Matt Forte. That makes sense because Forte was an excellent runner during his NFL career, showing dynamic quickness, receiving ability, elusiveness, and the ability to contribute in a variety of ways. Forte was a second-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft, and Michel could be a second-rounder in the 2018 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, New York Giants, Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, Oakland, Detroit and San Francisco ;There are a lot of teams that could consider taking Michel in the early rounds of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Browns moved on from Isaiah Crowell and signed Carlos Hyde. If they don’t land Saquon Barkley in the first round, Michel would make sense for one of their second-round picks.",1
"Matt Ioannidis",2
"Matt Judon",3
"Matt Judon.  Hall reminds me of Judon with the Ravens and Patriots. Judon was a fifth-round pick, but he probably would have gone higher if he hadn’t been coming out of a small school like Grand Valley State. Judon (6-3, 261) and Hall are similar size with speed off the edge.",1
"Matt Lengel",1
"Matt Moore.  I think Grier could be a quality backup quarterback like Moore was in his NFL career. Moore (6-3, 219) and Grier are almost identical in size, and Moore had physical limitations that kept him from being a starter. It would not surprise me if Grier has a career similar to Moore.;NFL Matches:  New York Giants, Jacksonville, Tampa Bay, Denver, Cincinnati, Miami, Washington, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles Chargers, New England",1
"Matt Moore.  Webb reminds me of Matt Moore in that they both have quality arms with some athleticism. Moore didn’t evolve into a starter, but he is one of the better backup quarterbacks in the NFL. I think Webb could end up being similar to Moore.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, San Francisco, Chicago, Houston, New Orleans, Arizona and Los Angeles Chargers ;There are a lot of quarterback-needy teams in the NFL, and that will help Webb to be selected in the top half of the 2017 NFL Draft. Obviously, the Browns are in dire need of a solution to their quarterback quandary. Cleveland also is loaded with draft picks, so Webb could be in play for one of them.",1
"Matt Paradis",1
"Matt Paradis. Bradbury reminds me of Paradis (6-3, 300). Both are tough, physical blockers who have some limitations that keep them from being elite interior blockers, but they are solid, strong, and find a way to get the job done. In the NFL, I see Bradbury being an effective center like Paradis.;NFL Matches:  Arizona, Denver, Tennessee, Tampa Bay, Carolina, Philadelphia, Minnesota, Kansas City",1
"Matt Paradis. Cushenberry reminds me some of Paradis. Paradis (6-3, 300) is a similar size, and they both have decent quickness and agility but struggle with power. They face similar limitations for taking on NFL defensive linemen. In the NFL, I could see Cushenberry topping out as a similar caliber player to Paradis.",1
"Matt Ryan",1
"Matt Ryan.  In terms of build and style of play, Goff is reminiscent of Ryan. Both are functional pocket passers who can challenge a defense with accuracy in all levels of the field. Goff is a better runner than Ryan, but Goff won’t be a true dual-threat quarterback in the NFL. Ryan was chosen with the third-overall pick in the 2008 NFL Draft, and Goff could also go in the top 10. If Goff lands with good talent around him, I could see him being a quarterback similar to Ryan, but I think not quite as good as Ryan.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, Dallas, San Francisco, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Houston, New York Jets and Buffalo",1

"Maurice Hurst",1
"Maurice Hurst.  Onwuzurike reminds me of Hurst. Both are fast penetrators who are more disruptive than productive. They also are slightly undersized, giving them the ability to create some pressure but not produce many sacks. Hurst (6-1, 291) would have been a second-day pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, but medical concerns caused him to slide. Onwuzurike could go on the second day of the 2021 NFL Draft.",1
"Maurice Hurst.  Winfrey reminds me of a taller version of Hurst. Hurst has some quickness, but he has never developed into being more than a backup-caliber player. Winfrey could be similar in the NFL.",1
"Max Starks",1
"Max Unger.  Pocic reminds me of Unger coming out of Oregon. Both are technicians who are intelligent, well-rounded blockers. Unger (6-5, 305) and Pocic are almost identical in size as well, with both players not having overpowering strength at the point of attack. Unger has had a good NFL career for the Seahawks and Saints after being a second-round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft. Pocic could also be a second-day pick.;NFL Matches:  Minnesota, Cleveland, Denver, Seattle, Cincinnati and Washington",1
"Max Valles",1
"Maxx Crosby",2
"Maxx Crosby.  As that director said above, Hutchinson has a similar style of play to Crosby. Hutchinson could be a rich-man’s Crosby considering Hutchinson has more physical talent. Crosby was one of the best defensive ends in the NFL in 2021, so that is high praise as a comparison for Hutchinson even though Crosby was not a high first-round pick himself.",1
"Medium-sized Ben Roethlisberger, Nick Foles",2
"Mega Derwin James",1
"Melvin Gordon",1
"Melvin Ingram",2
"Melvin Ingram  Harris reminds me of Ingram in that they are both very athletic and dangerously fast edge rushers. Harris is virtually the same size as Ingram (6-2, 247). Ingram is an excellent fit in a 3-4 defense as an outside linebacker, and Harris could be similar. Ingram was selected by the Chargers with the 18th-overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, and Harris could go in that same range this year.;NFL Matches:  New Orleans, Indianapolis, Baltimore, Washington, Detroit, Miami, Dallas, Green Bay, Pittsburgh and Atlanta",1
"Micah Hyde",1
"Micah Kiser",1
"Michael Bennett",2
"Michael Bennett.  Bullard’s game and skill set remind me of Bennett. Both are able to play end on run downs and move inside in passing situations. Bennett (6-4, 274) is a good pass-rusher with quickness, functional strength, and effort. He is very good at taking on right tackles and guards. I think Bullard could be similar in the NFL.;NFL Matches:  Baltimore, New Orleans, Detroit, New Orleans, Buffalo, Washington, Cincinnati, Arizona, Seattle and Denver",1
"Michael Boley",1
"Michael Brockers",1
"Michael Brockers. There are a lot of similarities between Reed and Brockers. Brockers (6-5, 326) is slightly bigger, but he also entered the NFL as a tough run defender who needed to develop his pass rush. Brockers isn’t a big sack producer, but he can contribute to the pass rush. Brockers was a mid-first-rounder in the 2014 NFL Draft, and Reed could go in the same range.;NFL Matches:  New York Giants, Detroit, New Orleans, Indianapolis, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Arizona, Seattle and Denver",1
"Michael Crabtree.  Crabtree (6-1, 215) and Kupp are almost identical in size. Both are well-rounded receivers who are gritty, but aren’t speed mismatches. After some rough years in San Francisco, Crabtree has blossomed as Oakland’s No. 2 receiver to Amari Cooper. Kupp would be best playing off a No. 1 as well as a No.2 or 3 receiver.;NFL Matches:  Buffalo, Philadelphia, Tennessee, Tampa Bay, Kansas City, Baltimore, Dallas, New England, San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles",1
"Michael Dean Perry",1
"Michael Floyd",1
"Michael Gallup",1
"Michael Huff",1
"Michael Johnson.  Ferguson reminds me of a smaller version of Johnson. Both are strong 4-3 base ends who struggle with stiffness. Johnson was a third-round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, and Ferguson could go in the second or third round this year.;NFL Matches:  San Francisco, Oakland, Detroit, Atlanta, New York Jets, New York Giants, Washington, Dallas, Carolina, Tennessee, Green Bay, Houston, New England, Kansas City",1
"Michael Johnson.  Johnson was a third-round pick by the Bengals in 2009 and was a solid end for Cincinnati over a 10-year career. He had a couple of seasons of good sack production, but he was the No. 2 rusher working off of Carlos Dunlap and Geno Atkins. Johnson was tough to set the edge in the ground game and contribute some rush. Hall could have a similar pro career.",1
"Michael Oher.  Ifedi reminds me of Oher. Oher (6-4, 315) can get movement in the ground game and do a solid job of blocking on the edge. However, Oher is inconsistent and can have rough stretches. Ifedi can be inconsistent as well, but doesn’t seem as volatile as Oher. Oher was a late first-round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, and Ifedi could go in that same area.;NFL Matches:  Atlanta, Indianapolis, New York Jets, Houston, Seattle, Kansas City, Carolina, Tennessee, Cleveland and San Francisco",1
"Michael Palardy",1
"Michael Pierce",1
"Michael Pittman Jr.",1
"Michael Pittman Jr.  Tillman reminds me of a poor man’s version of Pittman. Pittman is faster and more athletic, but both are big, strong, physical, and have some stiffness. Pittman was a second-day pick in his draft class, and Tillman could go on Day 2 in the 2023 NFL Draft.",1
"Michael Turner",2
"Michael Vick",1
"Michael Vick.  Sources from multiple teams have compared to Jackson to Vick from an on-the-field perspective. Both players are electric runners with strong arms capable of making devastating throws. Vick struggled with accuracy in many seasons during his NFL career, and Jackson has accuracy issues entering the league. Jackson receives solid marks for his intangibles, as opposed to Vick, who had awful character and horrible intangibles. Those issues led to Vick being a massive underachiever, and fortunately, Jackson does not have those problems.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, New York Giants, Buffalo, Washington, Arizona, Los Angeles Chargers, Jacksonville, New Orleans and Pittsburgh ;There are a lot of quarterback-needy teams in the NFL, and Jackson should have plenty of potential landing spots. The Browns need a franchise quarterback, and Jackson could be in play for them if they take position players at picks No. 1 and No. 4 and then target Jackson in a trade-up from the second round. ;The Giants could use a young franchise quarterback with Eli Manning aging. If they take a player like Saquon Barkley with the second-overall pick, they could target Jackson in a trade up from Round 2, or they could potentially trade down in the first round and take Jackson.",1
"Mike Boone",1
"Mike Brown.  Rapp reminds me of Mike Brown, who had a good career playing for the Chicago Bears. For a comparison to players currently playing in the NFL, Rapp could be a lesser version of Landon Collins or D.J. Swearinger.;NFL Matches:  Indianapolis, Los Angeles Rams, New England, Arizona, San Francisco, Tampa Bay, Carolina, Tennessee",1
"Mike Davis",1
"Mike Evans.  Team sources have compared Williams to Evans. As they both have an excellent ability to make catches over defenders. While defenders know passes are coming, they can’t stop them because the receiver’s size and leaping ability is so imposing. Williams and Evans also both have issues with dropped passes and creating separation. Williams is a little smaller than Evans, but he should be similar type of receiver to Evans in the NFL.;NFL Matches:  Buffalo, Arizona, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Tennessee, Tampa Bay",3
"Mike Evans/Kenny Golladay. If London can run well and play a little faster than expected, he could be a Mike Evans-type receiver. If the speed concerns translate to him being incapable of separating, London could be similar to Golladay.",1
"Mike Gesicki",1
"Mike Gesicki.  Team sources have compared Musgrave to Gesicki. Entering the NFL, Gesicki was also big, fast and athletic, but a terrible blocker. Musgrave could end up being a similar pro to Gesicki.",1
"Mike Gillislee",1
"Mike Gillislie",2
"Mike Hilton",1
"Mike Hull",1
"Mike McGlinchey.  For the NFL, Eichenberg reminds me of a lesser version of McGlinchey. Eichenberg does not have as good of a skill set, but they have similar style of play.",1
"Mike McGlinchey.  Steen and McGlinchey are very similar. They are both plus run blockers who also can be solid in pass protection, and each entered the NFL with a lot of experience. I could see Steen being a similar caliber blocker to McGlinchey as a pro.",1
"Mike Minter.  Jones reminds me of a bigger version of Minter. Minter was a second-round pick who went on to have an excellent NFL career. He was a tough, physical presence who turned himself into a well-rounded defender. I think Jones could end up being similar in the NFL and also might be a second-round pick.;NFL Matches:  Tampa Bay, Houston, Seattle, Buffalo, New York Jets, Atlanta, Carolina, Cleveland, Chicago, Cincinnati, Los Angeles Chargers and Pittsburgh",1
"Mike Mitchell",1
"Mike Pennel",1
"Mike Rumph.  Mullen and Rumph (6-2, 205) are almost identical in size. Rumph was a good tackler, but his issues in coverage and not having good technique ended up leading to him not panning out in the NFL. As a pro, I could see Mullen having similar issues to Rumph.;NFL Matches:  Tampa Bay, New York Giants, Denver, Washington, Carolina, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Houston, Kansas City, Philadelphia",1
"Mike Rumph.  Terrell and Rumph (6-2, 205) are similar in size. Rumph was a good tackler who had issues in coverage, and not having good technique ended up leading to him not panning out in the NFL.",1

"Minkah Fitzpatrick",2
"Minkah Fitzpatrick/Tyrann Mathieu. Branch is a tough player to compare because he is rather unique with his ability to play cornerback and safety. Perhaps the closest thing to Branch are defenders like Fitzpatrick and Mathieu. All three of them have all shown the ability to play safety or slot corner, and they are versatile instinctive defenders. Team sources have said Branch reminds them of Fitzpatrick at Alabama.",1
"Mohamed Sanu. Bateman kind of reminds me of Sanu. Sanu (6-2, 210) and Bateman are almost identical in size and have a gritty style of play. However, Sanu has better hands and was much more sure-handed at Rutgers than Bateman was at Minnesota. After being a second-day pick, Sanu has put together a solid career as a possessional receiver, and Bateman could follow suit.",1
"Mohamed Sanu. Bell kind of reminds me of Sanu. Sanu (6-2, 210) and Bell are almost identical in size and have a gritty style of play. After being a second-day pick, Sanu has put together a solid career as a possessional receiver, and Bell could follow suit as a pro",1
"Mohamed Sanu. Mims reminds me of Sanu. Sanu (6-2, 210) and Mims are almost identical in size with a gritty style of play. Sanu has had a solid career as a possessional receiver, and Mims could follow suit.",1
"Mohamed Sanu. Mingo kind of reminds me of Sanu. Sanu (6-2, 210) and Mingo are almost identical in size with a gritty style of play. After being a second-day pick, Sanu has had a solid career as a possessional receiver. Mingo could follow a similar professional path.",1
"Mohamed Sanu. Smith-Schuster’s game is similar to Sanu as possession receivers who can be effective as No. 2 wideouts in the NFL. They are similar in size, and Sanu (6-2, 210) is a run-after-the-catch receiver like Smith-Schuster. Sanu and Smith-Schuster have comparable speed as well. Sanu was a second-day pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, and Smith-Schuster will slip to Day 2.;NFL Matches:  San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles Rams, Buffalo, Philadelphia, Tennessee, Tampa Bay, Kansas City, Baltimore, Dallas and New Orleans",2
"Montez Sweat",2
"Montez Sweat.  Some team sources said Wilson reminds them of Sweat, but Wilson is more physical against the run. Another team source called Wilson similar to Carlos Dunlap.",1
"Montrae Holland",1
"Morgan Moses.  I can see a similar style with Kinnard and Moses. Moses (6-6, 330) was an astute third-round pick by Washington in 2014 and has become a solid right tackle in the NFL. Kinnard is similar in size and skill set. If he stays at right tackle, Kinnard could be a blocker who is comparable to Moses.",1
"Morgan Moses.  Team sources said Jenkins was similar to Moses. Moses (6-6, 330) was an astute third-round pick by Washington in 2014 and has become a solid right tackle in the NFL. Jenkins is similar in size and skill set. If he stays at right tackle, Jenkins could be a blocker who is comparable to Moses.",1
"Morgan Moses. In speaking to team sources, they agree that Moses could be a quality comparison for Taylor, except that they feel that Taylor is a quicker and more athletic version. That explains why Taylor is a first-round talent and Moses went on Day 2. Still, Moses was a wise pick by the Redskins, as he is one of the better right tackles in the NFL. Moses (6-6, 335) and Taylor are almost identical in size while being well-balanced blockers who are assets in both phases.;NFL Matches:  Arizona, New York Jets, Buffalo, Cleveland, Atlanta, Carolina, Philadelphia, Houston, Minnesota, Los Angeles Rams",1
"Morris Claiborne.  White is a similar cover corner to Claiborne. That is the version of Claiborne who was very solid in 2016 and not the player who struggled early in his career. Claiborne was a high first-rounder in the 2012 NFL Draft.

"Morris Claiborne. After a slow start, Claiborne turned into a capable NFL cornerback. Claiborne (5-11, 192) and Fulton are almost identical in size and have a similar style of play.",1
"Muhammed Wilkerson.  In conversations with scouts, they have compared Jones to Wilkerson in terms of his athletic skill set. If Jones is dedicated and works hard, he could be a player similar to Wilkerson. If Jones doesn’t develop a work ethic and lacks a passion for the game, he probably will be a poor man’s Wilkerson.;NFL Matches:  Baltimore, New Orleans, Detroit, Buffalo, Washington, Cincinnati, Arizona, Seattle and Denver",3

"Ndamukong Suh.  Brown may not top out as highly as Suh did as a sack producer early in his career, but with refinement, Brown should produce quality sack numbers. Brown and Suh are both incredibly strong, physical, athletic and quick. Suh (6-4, 313) and Brown are similar size. Early in his career, Suh had the ability to take over games at the point of attack, and Brown does as well.",1
"Ndamukong Suh.  Jones reminds me of the older Buccaneers version of Suh, not the young one that played for the Lions and was capable off double digit sack seasons. Like the old Sub, Jones is a tough run defender that is physical at the point of attack and capable of getting some push as a pass rusher. If Jones pans out, he could be a nose tackle similar to the player that Suh has been in the past few years in Tampa Bay.",1
"Nelson Agholor",1
"Nick Chubb",1

"Nick Fairley",1
"Nick Fairley.  Blacklock reminds me of a poor man’s Fairley. Fairley (6-4, 308) and Blacklock are almost identical in size with quickness, athleticism, and an ability to contribute to the interior pass rush. Injury issues are also something both players have in common. If Blacklock improves, I could see him being similar to Fairley, but maybe not quite as good.",1
"Nick Fairley.  Fairley has been a good player when motivated. He can be a stout run defender and contributes as a pass-rusher. Like Fairley, Butler has a ton of natural talent. They are similar size and athletic. Fairley was a mid-first-round pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, and Butler could go as high as the middle of Round 1 to early in Round 2.;NFL Matches:  Buffalo, Washington, Houston, Cincinnati, Green Bay, Arizona, Seattle, Denver, Baltimore, New Orleans, Detroit and New Orleans",1
"Nick Mangold.  Ragnow remains me of Mangold, and that is a real compliment to Ragnow. Over his career, Mangold was one of the best centers in the NFL. Mangold (6-4, 307) and Ragnow are identical in size with similar quickness and athleticism that give them special skill sets. In the 2006 NFL Draft, Mangold was the 29th overall-pick, and Ragnow could go in the same region in the 2018 NFL Draft. Ragnow could have a long solid NFL career like Mangold had with the Jets.;NFL Matches:  NFL Matches:  Detroit, Buffalo, Cincinnati, New York Giants, Tampa Bay, Washington and Tennessee ;There are a lot of teams that could consider an upgrade at either center or guard late in the first round and early in the second round of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Lions could consider adding Ragnow in the range, but he might be a reach in the top 20. If Detroit trades down, however, Ragnow could make sense to help improve the team’s rushing offense and pass protection. ;The Bengals could use a center upgrade, and Ragnow could get consideration for Cincinnati in the first round. Buffalo lost Eric Wood to retirement, and Ragnow could make sense for the Bills’ second selection of the first round if it isn’t used in a package to trade up. ;Tennessee needs an improvement over Ben Jones at center, where Ragnow could be a great fit. However, the Titans will probably address other needs in the first round, and it is extremely unlikely that Ragnow will make it to their second-round pick.",1
"Nick Mangold. Sources have compared Kelly to Mangold and that is great news for Kelly as Mangold is one of the top centers in the NFL. He has been since being a first-round pick (29th overall) in the 2006 NFL Draft. Mangold (6-4, 307) and Kelly are virtually identical in size and skill set. In the NFL, Kelly could have a long solid career like Mangold has.;NFL Matches:  San Francisco, Seattle, Houston, Jacksonville, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Atlanta and Washington",1
"Nick Martin",1
"Nick Martin. Dickerson is a tough player to find a good comparison because he is much bigger in terms of height and weight than vast majority of NFL centers. In terms of style of play as a smart interior blocker eho is a good technician, Dickerson reminds me of Martin, who has turned into a solid starter for the Texans. Martin was a second-round pick, and Dickerson could be as well if his medical history doesn’t frighten teams away.",1

Spence was a high second-round pick by Tampa Bay in 2016, but he was a disappointment and has ended up being a backup-caliber pass rusher. I could see B.J. Ojulari being a better version of Spence as a rotational pass rusher in NFL.",1
"Noah Spence.  Multiple team sources said Ojulari was similar to Spence. Spence (6-2, 251) and Ojulari are almost identical in size and have some skill-set limitations. Spence was a high second-round pick by Tampa Bay in the 2016 NFL Draft, but he was a disappointment and has ended up being a backup-caliber pass rusher. I could see Ojulari having a similar career.",1
"Nyheim Hines.  From a skill-set perspective, Hines (5-9, 196) and Achane are very similar. Both are fast running backs who are explosive weapons who can rip off chunk gains on any touch and contribute as returners. Hines is stronger, while Achane could be faster. If Achane pans out in the NFL, I think he could be a back similar to Hines.",1
"Nyheim Hines.  From the skill-set perspective, Hines (5-9, 196) and Cook are very similar. Both are fast, explosive weapons who can rip off chunk gains on any touch. N.C.

"Odell Beckham Jr.  Wilson’s overall style of play in terms of his speed, route-running, and yards-after-the-catch skills remind me of Beckham.

Both are pocket passers who throw the ball accurately with timing and precision. Both also are known to be good leaders, workers and teammates. One difference is in their styles of leadership; Rivers is more loud and vocal whereas Darnold is quieter. Still, their playing styles are similar and both have excellent intangibles, but of a different nature. Rivers was a top-five pick in the 2004 NFL Draft, and Darnold could easily be a top-five pick in the 2018 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, New York Giants, New York Jets, Denver and Buffalo ;There are a lot of quarterback-needy teams in the NFL, and Darnold should be gone quickly in the top-four picks. The Browns need a franchise quarterback, and Darnold is a favorite to be their selection with the No. 1-overall pick. ;If Cleveland passes on Darnold, the Giants could be a fit for Darnold with the No. 2-overall pick.

"Preston Smith.  Davenport was a difficult player to form a comparison fro as he is very unique with his skill set as a talented, but raw, player coming out of a small school. Some players I considered were Derrick Morgan, Robert Ayers and Michael Johnson, but none of them really felt right to me. Thus, I went to a team’s director of college scouting to get their take. Here is that opinion. ;“I’m thinking Preston Smith as a [comparison] for Davenport. Davenport is a lot longer than Ayers and Derrick Morgan. Michael Johnson is more freakish athletically, but not as physical or nearly as strong versus the run coming out of college. Davenport is probably a little more athletic than Smith, and Davenport is expected to run better. Davenport could have more upside as a pass-rusher, but they are similar. Preston is an eight-sacks-per-year guy, and Davenport I think eventually will be an 8-10 sack guy. Davenport is really physical versus the run. He’s sort of like a less explosive Jadeveon Clowney, a poor man’s Clowney. Davenport is raw as hell though.” NFL Matches:  Tampa Bay, San Francisco, Oakland, Miami, Green Bay, Seattle, Detroit, Los Angeles Rams, Carolina, Tennessee, New Orleans and New England",1
"Preston Smith.  In some ways, Gross-Matos reminds me of Smith coming out of Mississippi State. Smith (6-5, 265) and Gross-Matos are almost identical in size. Both players were well-rounded defenders, but were not blinding fast or overpowering. I could see Gross-Matos turning into a good edge defender like Smith has for the Packers and Redskins.",1

"Prospect Comparison:;A.J. Green. In conversations, team sources compared Harrison to Green, CeeDee Lamb and Tee Higgins. Among those comparisons, I could see Harrison having a career similar to Green. With height, speed and route-running, Green was a lethal receiver, and Harrison could be a similar style pro.",2
"Prospect Comparison:;Aaron Banks. In some ways, Banks is reminiscent of Jackson. They both are barrel-chested right guards who pack a punch in the ground game and can hold their own in pass protection. Banks was a second-round pick, and Robinson could go in the same range this year. Robinson could end up becoming a guard similar to Banks in the NFL.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Alec Pierce. Rice is reminiscnet of Pierce coming out of Cincinnati. Both had a nice combination of size and speed with some raw points of development that needed refinement for the next level.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Amani Oruwariye. King is like a smaller version of Oruwariye. Oruwariye had a big 2021 season in terms of ball production, but he has struggled with giving up separation in other years in his career. Oruwariye was a fifth-round pick, and King could be a mid-rounder in the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Andrew Wylie. Fisher reminds me of Wylie playing right tackle for the Chiefs in 2022. In the NFL, Fisher could be a decent, but not special, starter similar to Wylie.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Antonio Bryant. Bryant (6-1, 205) and Burton are almost identical in size and possess similar skill sets. In his prime, Bryant was fast, a big-play threat who was excellent at generating separation. Bryant also had character concerns that caused him to be a very late second-round pick. Burton could go in the same range in the 2024 NFL Draft, and he could be a good pro receiver similar to what Bryant was at times during his pro career.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Baker Mayfield. Nix reminds me of Mayfield, but Nix has more size, is a better athlete, and a better runner. They also both have some arm limitations. Nix could end up being a solid, but not elite, starter – similar to what Mayfield has become in the NFL.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Baker Mayfield/Zach Wilson. If Rattler turns into a quality starter, I could see him being similar to a better version of Mayfield as Rattler has a stronger arm and more athletic ability. If Rattler does not turn into a starter, I think he could be a backup quarterback similar to Wilson. Both have strong arms, running ability, and are gunslingers who can be prone to making bad decisions.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Barrett Ruud. Wilson reminds me somewhat of Ruud. Ruud was a fast and instinctive linebacker over his career. Ruud (6-2, 240) also lacked some strength and was a drag-down tackler, but he did produce some big tackle totals in his prime with Tampa Bay. As a pro, Wilson could be similar to Ruud.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Ben Cleveland. Goncalves reminds me of Cleveland coming out of Georgia. Cleveland had been a guard/tackle with the Bulldogs before settling in as a starting guard for the Ravens. I could see Goncalves being a power right guard in the NFL similar to Cleveland.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Benardrick McKinney. Cooper is reminiscent of McKinney at Mississippi State. McKinney (6-4, 257) and Cooper are both big linebackers with some limitations in pass coverage as they are not natural with it. McKinney was a second-round pick by the Texans and turned into a solid starter before his career crashed. Cooper could end up being a similar style of pro linebacker.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Bradlee Anae. Studying Trice brings Anae to mind. Both were productive college pass rushers who lacked juice and had some stiffness for the NFL. Anae (6-3, 260) and Trice have similar size and skill sets. In the NFL, Trice could end up being a similar rotational backup, like Anae.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Brandon Facyson. Sources called Pritchett a faster version of Brandon Facyson.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Brandon Scherff. For the NFL, Fuaga is similar to Scheff coming out of Iowa. Both were bulls in the ground game who could be physically dominant and violent. Scherff (6-5, 315) also played tackle in college, but his lack of arm length and feet made him a better fit inside at guard in the NFL. I could see the same future for Fuaga, who could potentially be a similar caliber player to the Pro Bowl guard Scherff.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Breshad Perriman. Legette is reminiscent of Perriman coming out of Central Florida. Perriman (6-2, 215) and Legette are close to the same size and showed good speed for big receivers. Perriman also had some rawness entering the NFL, and that led to him being a late first-rounder. Legette could be a better version of Perriman as a pro.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Brian Branch. Branch was a phenomenal in his rookie season with the Lions. He played safety and nickel corner and making a lot of clutch tackles for Detroit. Bullard could be a Branch-like defender in the NFL. Also like Branch, Bullard could be a second-day prospect.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Brian Burns. A few team sources have said Turner has a similar skill set to Burns coming out of Florida State. They said Burns was more bendy and had more developed pass-rushing moves, while Turner is stronger and tougher against the run compared to how Burns was with the Seminoles. As a pro, Turner could develop into being an edge rusher similar to Burns.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Brian O’Neill. Rosengarten reminds me of O’Neill coming out of Pittsbrugh. They both had some athleticism and quickness, but lacked play strength. O’Neill was a second-day pick, and Rosengarten could go on Day 2 in the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;C.J. Gardner-Johnson. DeJean could be a dangerous hybrid slot corner and safety in, similar to Gardner-Johnson.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Cam Jordan. Verse has a similar playing style to Jordan. Both are dangerous pass rushers who offer physical run defense. Jordan was a late first-round pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, and Verse could be a late first-rounder in the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Cam Sutton. Lassiter is similar to Sutton. Both are tough, instinctive and willing tacklers, who bring gritty play to the field. Sutton (5-11, 180) and Lassiter are also nearly identical in size. Additionally, they have the issue of getting run by at times and are good fits as zone corners.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Cardale Jones. Milton reminds me of Jones coming out of Ohio State. Jones (6-5, 260) was also a big quarterback with a cannon for an arm and lacked refinement as a passer. Jones was a fourth-round pick in 2016, and Milton could go in the same range this year. If Milton has a good work ethic, he has the potential to stick in the NFL, while that issue prevented Jones from panning out.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Carlton Davis. Hart reminds me of Carlton Davis coming out of Auburn. Davis (6-1, 206) and Hart are almost identical in size. Davis was a second-round pick of Tampa Bay in 2018 and has turned into a good pro starter. Hart could follow a similar path.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Chris Godwin. Pearsall’s combination of size, quickness, and route-running remind me of Godwin. Godwin was a second-day pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, and Pearsall has the ability to be a dangerous starter and an excellent second-day value pick like Godwin was.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Christian Gonzalez. Wiggins reminds me of Gonzalez in terms of being tall, long, fast and athletic, while lacking some physicality. Gonzalez was a mid-first-round pick in 2023, and Wiggins could go in the same range this year during the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Cullen Jenkins. Kris Jenkins reminds me more of his uncle Cullen rather than his father, Kris. Cullen Jenkins could play outside or inside while the elder Kris Jenkins was a natural defensive tackle. Cullen Jenkins was a physical and productive player for the Packers, and the elder Kris Jenkins had a superb career for the Carolina Panthers. I think the younger Kris Jenkins could be a good pro starter like his father and uncle.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;D.J. Reader. When Sweat is playing well, he reminds me of Reader. Reader has been a fantastic nose tackle for the Texans and the Bengals. Reader has an ability to stuff runs while also creating a push in the pass rush to prevent quarterbacks from stepping up in the pocket. If Sweat works hard to maximize his talent, he could be a pro player similar to Reader. However, if Sweat is lazy and too heavy, those things could lead to him not panning out in the NFL.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Damarri Mathis. Team sources have compared Brownlee to Mathis.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Daniel Jones/Will Levis. Some team sources compared McCarthy to Jones, while some others said Will Levis. McCarthy reminds me of Jones in terms of athleticism, running ability, and quality arm talent. However also like Jones, there are a lack of passing instincts and some stretches of play when he does not make plays as a passer.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Daron Payne. Murphy compares well to a shorter version of Payne.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;David Montgomery. Davis is similar to Montgomery coming out of Iowa State. Both are physical runners who can contribute as receivers. Davis could be a solid pro starter, like Montgomery. Montgomery went in the third round, and Davis could go in the same range in the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Dee Ford. Team sources have said Robinson is similar to Ford, but Robinson is more athletic. Ford notched a couple of double-digit sack seasons for the Chiefs after being a first-round pick. If Robinson pans out in the NFL, he could be an edge rusher similar to Ford.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Denico Autry.  Fiske is something like a shorter version of Autry. Florida State had listed Fiske as 6-foot-5, but at the Senior Bowl, he was two inches shorter. Autry (6-5, 285) has issues holding up as a run defender, but is a dangerous interior pass rusher while being light for an NFL defensive tackle. If Fiske can stick in the NFL, he could be a dangerous interior rusher similar to Autry.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Devin Bush. Colson is similar to Bush. They both showed some pass-coverage ability but were not very instinctive. Lacking instincts came back to hurt Bush in the NFL.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Donte Jackson. Melton is similar to Jackson coming out of LSU. Both were extremely fast corners capable of running the route and preventing separation thanks to their speed to go along with smooth athleticism. Jackson and Melton are almost identical in size. Jackson was a second-round pick, and Melton could go in Round 2 this year during the 2024 NFL Draft. Melton could plausibly end up being a comparable pro to Jackson.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Dorance Armstrong. Isaac compares well to Armstrong coming out of Kansas in 2018. Armstrong was a strong run defender who flashed pass-rushing ability. Armstrong (6-4, 255) and Isaac are almost identical in size with athletic upside to develop.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Dre Kirkpatrick. McKinstry reminds me of Kirkpatrick. McKinstry is almost identical in size to Kirkpatrick (6-2, 186), with both having good height, length and straight-line speed. Kirkpatrick was more fluid athletically, but in the NFL, I think McKinstry could end up being similar to Kirkpatrick if McKinstry discovers a work ethic and applies himself.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Earl Bennett. Corley reminds of the former Chicago receiver. Bennett (5-11, 209) was almost identical in size and playing style. Bennett was a third-round pick in 2008, and Corley could go in the same range this year during the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Elijah Molden. Sainristil is reminiscent of Molden coming out of Washington. Molden lacked size but also was a gritty defender who found a way to contribute. In the NFL, Molden has been a rotational slot corner, and Sainristil could be a similar pro.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Elijah Molden. Smith-Wade is similar to Molden coming out of Washington in 2021. Holden is a rotational slot corner who can contribute in his role. As a pro, I think Smith-Wade could become a better version and turn into a starting nickel in time.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Eric Murray. Carson reminds me of Murray coming out of Minnesota. Murray was a tough, physical and gritty cornerback, but had a lack of speed. Eventually, Murray was moved to safety. He has managed to become a solid pro there after being a fourth-round pick. Carson has the potential to be a similar player who could be a third-day pick who ends up moving to safety.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Evan Neal. Latham is very similar to Neal. Neal (6-7, 360) and Latham are almost identical in size while being similar players. Both can overwhelm and dominate as run blockers and possess enough athleticism and quickness to stay on the edge at right tackle.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Gabe Jackson. In some ways, Zinter is reminiscent of Jackson. They both are strong right guards who can contribute in the ground game, but have some limitations in pass protection. Jackson was a third-round pick back in 2014, and Zinter could go in the same range during the 2024 NFL Draft. Zinter has the potential to be a similar NFL guard similar to Jackson.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Garrett Wilson. Nabers’ overall style of play, with his speed, route-running, and yards-after-the-catch skills is reminiscent of Wilson. They also are almost identical in size, except Nabers looks stronger. Wilson went in the top 10 of the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft, and I could see Nabers going in the top 10 of the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Grady Jarrett. Hall has a similar style of play to Jarrett. Jarrett is bigger (6-0, 305), while Hall could be a little faster.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Greg Dulcich. Stover is similar to Dulcich coming out of UCLA. Dulcich was a late-bloomer in college who flashed receiving potential. Dulcich then contributed some as a rookie before losing his second season to injury. If Stover pans out better than Dulcich, Stover could be similar to Jared Cook.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Haason Reddick. Reddick was a bust with the Cardinals, but he invigorated his career with the Panthers when he was moved to being an edge rushing Sam – strongside – linebacker and edge rusher. Reddick (6-1, 240) and Liufau are almost identical in size while being fast and explosive.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Hunter Long. Long reminds me of Hunter Long coming out of Boston College. Long (6-5, 253) was a quality blocker who could contribute as a receiver. In the pros, Long has been a backup tight end, and I could see Johnson being similar. Long was a third-round pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, and Johnson could go in the same range this year during the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Irv Smith Jr. Bell compares well with Smith coming out of Alabama. Both are receiving tight ends who are undersized and face limitations as blockers.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Jaelan Phillips. In terms of style of play, Latu reminds me of Phillips. Phillips has a little more speed, athleticism and explosion, while Latu showed more instincts and hand usage. They are almost identical in size and had some similarities in their development as collegiate players. Latu could potentially become an NFL edge rusher similar to Phillips.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Jamaal Williams. Benson reminds me of Williams when he was running well with the Lions. Williams is a powerful back with a good burst who also can contribute some as a receiver. In the NFL, Benson could be a similar running back to Williams.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;James Bradberry. Mitchell is reminiscent Bradberry, Both are big, quick, smooth athletes who can really cover. Bradberry had a lot of upside coming out Samford in 2016, and Mitchell does as well coming out of Toledo. They also are both smaller-school products who will need transition time given the huge jump in competition.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;James White. Shipley is reminiscent to White with the Patriots. Both were good receivers who could contribute somewhat in the ground game as well, but limited to being backups. White was a fourth-round pick in 2014, and Shipley could go in the same range in the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Jamison Crowder/Skyy Moore. Crowder (5-9, 177) and Wilson are similar in size while both being dangerous slot receivers. Like Wilson, Crowder was a quick route-runner who could get open and had reliable hands. In the NFL, I think Wilson could be similar player to Crowder. If Wilson does not translate as well as Crowder did, he could be a backup receiver similar to Moore.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Jaquan Brisker. Nubin compares well with Brisker in terms of style of play and skill set. Brisker (6-1, 200) and Nubin are the same size and possess similar strengths and limitations. Brisker was a second-day pick in 2022, and Nubin could go on Day 2 in the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Jared Goff. Some team sources have said Maye is like Jared Goff, expect Maye is a better runner than Goff. It makes sense given that Maye is a very accurate rhythm passer like Goff. The sources who really like Maye think he is a better version of Goff with more athleticism and running ability. Other sources who aren’t in love with Maye have compared him to Kenny Pickett.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;John Metchie/Hunter Renfrow. Metchie and McConkey are identical in size and have similar skill sets. Neither is especially dominant in terms of size or speed, but they are polished receivers. With McConkey having only played one season, another comparison would be Renfrow. Renfrow was an excellent slot receiver in Jon Gruden’s offense, but has not been as effective since Las Vegas changed schemes.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Jonathan Greenard. Kneeland is somewhat reminiscent of Greenard coming out of Florida. They both were strong edge rushers who played hard but faced some limitations with stiffness and athleticism. Greenard (6-3, 265) and Kneeland are almost identical in size. Greenard was a second-day pick who turned into a good starter, and Kneeland has that potential as well.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Jonnu Smith. In terms of style of play, Bowers looks liked San Francisco’s George Kittle (6-4, 250) in his games with Georgia. Kittle, however, is significantly bigger than Bowers by 20 pounds and has more height and length. Jonnu Smith (6-3, 248) is closer in size to Bowers, and Smith has been a dangerous receiving tight end in the NFL. Smith and Bowers are fast, good route-runners with athleticism. They also are undersized for blocking NFL front-seven defenders. Thus as a pro, Bowers could end up being a player similar to Smith.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Jonnu Smith. Like Smith, Sanders is a smooth route-runner with quickness to separate. They also are similarly sized and possess limitations as blockers. Smith (6-3, 248) is a solid contributing receiving tight end for Tennessee, and Sanders could end up as a similar pro. Smith was a late third-round pick in 2017, and Sanders could also go in Round 3 this year in the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Josh Dobbs. Penix reminds me of Dobbs. Both can be inconsistent passers who are playmakers when they are on their game and struggle when they are off. Both Penix and Dobbs have some athleticism and running ability. Dobbs was a mid-round pick to be a backup, and Penix could start out his pro career in a similar manner. Some NFL team sources said Penix is similar to Hendon Hooker at Tennessee, but Penix is left-handed and not as accurate as Hooker was in college.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Josh Reynolds. Polk is reminiscent of Reynolds. They both are solid polished receivers with good hands but lack speed. Reynolds is a capable No. 2 or 3 receiver in the NFL, and Polk could end up being a similar style of pro player.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Josh Reynolds. Team sources said Mitchell is similar to Reynolds, who has become a solid starting wide receiver for the Lions. They shared they feel Mitchell could be a better, more athletic version of Reynolds.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Justin Madubuike/Marvin Austin. Newton is somewhat reminiscent of Madubuike coming out of Texas A&M. They both are quick interior rushers with athleticism and a boxy build. Madubuike was a better run defender, and character issues caused him to slide in his draft class. NFL team sources labelled Madubuike as a positive comparison for Newton, but if Newton doesn’t work hard and plays with an inconsistent motor, he could end up being a bust like Austin. If Newton works hard and pans out, he could be a dangerous interior pass rusher akin to Madubuike.",2
"Prospect Comparison:;Kelvin Benjamin. Multiple team sources compared Wilson to Benjamin. Both were giant receivers for the Seminoles who present a size mismatch and a threat to make catches over defensive backs. Each also lacked the speed and separation skills to get away from NFL defensive backs.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Kenneth Walker. In terms of running style, Corum is similar to Walker as a downhill violent runner who can pick up yards after contact and has moves to dodge tacklers. Corum is nearly identical in size to Walker (5-9, 211), and I could see Corum being a good pro starter like Walker.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Kerby Joseph. Kinchens reminds me of Joseph in that he is a ballhawking instinctive safety who also can deliver some hard hits. Joseph was a phenomenal third-round pick by the Lions, and I think Kinchens could be a similar steal in the NFL after going on Day 2 of the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Kevin Zeitler. Beebe compares well to Zeitler coming out of Wisconsin. Zeitler (6-4, 339) is strong and has some athletic limitations, which also summarizes Beebe. As a pro, Zeitler has been a solid starter, and Beebe could follow a similar path in the NFL.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Kyle Fuller. Arnold reminds me of Fuller (5-11, 200) during his good seasons with the Bears. Fuller was a good athlete and instinctive. He was faster than Arnold, hence Fuller went in the top half of the first round in his draft. Arnold, meanwhile, could go a little lower in the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Lamar Jackson. Some team sources say Daniels is a lot like Jackson. Both are fast, dynamic runners, with quality size and toughness. They each have some faults as a passer, but they make up for it with big plays and definitely have the passing ability to be effective throwing the ball. In the NFL, I think Daniels is going to be a dynamic playmaking dual-threat quarterback like Jackson is.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Landon Collins. Bishop compares well with Collins in that both are strong safeties who will hit, defend the run, are effective in zone, have ball skills, and face some limitations in man coverage. Collins got a boost playing at Alabama to have him go high in the second round of 2015. I think Bishop could end up as an NFL safety with a similar style of play to Collins.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Leroy Hill. Some team sources said Gray reminded them of the former Seahawks linebacker Hill. Hill (6-1, 238) are almost identical in size and have similar styles of play. Hill was a third-round pick in the 2005 NFL Draft before putting together a solid career with Seattle.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;L’Jarius Sneed. Team sources have said Bullock reminds them of Sneed coming out of college. Sneed was a lean safety who had to move to corner in the NFL. Bullock could follow a similar career path and turn into a solid pro starter.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Markus Golden. Braswell is similar to Golden coming out of Missouri. Golden (6-2, 260) showed speed off the edge with strength for his size. Golden was a second-round pick in 2015, and Braswell could go in the second frame during the 2024 NFL Draft. If Braswell develops and pans out in the NFL, he could be an edge defender similar to Golden, who has put together some productive years rushing the quarterback for the Cardinals and Giants.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Thomas is very similar to Valdes-Scantling. They are almost identical in size while both have deep speed to stretch defenses vertically. Valdes-Scantling (6-4, 205) has a habit of playing a little smaller than his listed numbers and has some finesse aspects to his game. In the NFL, Thomas could end up being a wideout similar to Valdes-Scantling as a player who will flash big-time ability.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Michael Pittman Jr. Team sources said Coleman reminds them of Pittman. They shared they feel Coleman could be a similar quality pro starter like Pittman has become for Indianapolis.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Mike Evans. Odunze reminds me of Evans with his style of play, but I do not believe Odunze will be as good as the future Hall of Famer. However, I think Evans is faster and is better at separating from coverage through route-running. Odunze could be a good pro receiver who might be a poor-man’s version of Evans.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Mike McGlinchey. Sources with NFL team have compared Alt to McGlinchey (6-8, 315). They are almost identical in size and have the same weaknesses of being a little stiff, not bending well, and having some anchor issues. However like McGlinchey in the 2018 NFL Draft, Alt is a safe pick to be a good NFL starter with Pro Bowl potential.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Pat Mahomes/Kyler Murray. I don’t believe Williams will reach Mahomes’ level of success, but Williams’ skill set and style of play remind me of Mahomes. Some team sources said Williams looked like a bigger, thicker Kyler Murray, in their opinion.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Penei Sewell. Suamataia is a poor man’s version of Sewell, who is his cousin. Suamataia has a good skill set like Sewell, but Sewell was more polished and reliable coming out of Oregon. Sewell has also only gotten better. Suamataia has the upside to be a good pro starter, but I do not believe he will be close to as good as Sewell has become. That is not necessarily a fair comparison considering Sewell is among the very best offensive linemen in the NFL.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Pete Werner. Eichenberg has a similar play style to Werner. Werner (6-3, 242) was a second-round pick out of Ohio State in 2021, and Eichenberg could go on Day 2 of the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Phil Loadholt. Some team sources have said Guyton is similar to Loadholt. Both are massive offensive linemen from Oklahoma. Loadholt (6-8, 345) was a second-round pick, and Guyton should be an early-rounder this year in the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Rashawn Slater. Team sources have compared Fautanu to Slater, which makes a lot of sense. There were some teams sources that said they thoughy Slater lacked the length to stay at tackle in the NFL, and there are the same questions about Fautanu. Slater checked in at 6-foot-3, 305 pounds entering the league and since then has added about 10 pounds. Fautanu is almost identical in size to Slater, and both are very good athletes.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Rhamondre Stevenson. Stevenson (6-0, 227) and Allen are almost identical in size while both being physical downhill runners. Stevenson was a mid-rounder in the 2021 NFL Draft, and Allen could go in the same region this year in the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Rob Kelley/Craig Reynolds. Estime compares well to Kelley or Reynolds as a power back with some limitations. Reynolds has turned into a valuable backup in the NFL, and Estime could be a similar pro.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Robbie Chosen – formerly Robbie Anderson.  Franklin is very similar to Chosen. Both are fast receivers who are tall and skinny. Franklin has some limitations similar to Chosen’s. If Franklin pans out, I could see him being a wideout similar to Anderson.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Russell Okung. Okung was a quality starting left tackle in the NFL after being the sixth-overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. Okung was good, although not great for the Seahawks, Broncos, Chargers, and Panthers. Okung (6-5, 310) and Fashanu have similar size and skill sets, plus are solid but not dominant players. In the NFL, I could see Fashanu having a career similar to Okung.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Sean Smith. In some ways, Tampa reminds me of Smith. Like Smith, there is good size alongside speed concerns. Smith was a second-round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, and Tampa could go as high as Round 2 of the 2024 NFL Draft, but he might be more likely to be a third- or fourth-round pick. Tampa could have a similar pro career to Smith.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Taven Bryan. Orhorhoro is reminiscent of Bryan. Bryan (6-4, 291) and Orhorhoro are similar size with athleticism, but both have not produced up to their skill sets.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Taylor Decker. Morgan is similar to Decker as both are athletic, quick pass protectors. They both are finesse blockers who are not overly physical and are not finishers. Decker was picked in the back half of the first round of his draft class, and Morgan could go in that range this year during the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Terance Steele. Paul reminds me of Steele because there is talent to work with and yet needed development. Steele was a superb undrafted free agent signing by the Cowboys, and he has turned into a serviceable starting right tackle. If Paul develops well, I could see him being similar to Steele.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Travis Fredrick. Barton is reminiscent of Fredrick. They are almost identical in size and tough fighters at the line of scrimmage. Fredrick (6-4, 320) had the size to be a guard or center, but center was his best fit. I could see center being Barton’s best fit as a pro.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Travis Fredrick. Powers-Johnson is reminiscent of Fredrick coming out of Wisconsin. In college, both were strong, tough, physical and well-rounded blockers. Fredrick was a late first-round pick in 2013, while Powers-Johnson could be a first- or second-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. Powers-Johnson could potentially be a similar blocker to what Frederick was during his career with the Cowboys.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Tre White. Team sources said Rakestraw reminds them of White coming out of LSU. White was a well-rounded cornerback in college and a late first-round pick in his draft class. Rakestraw is similar in his play and could be a late first- or early second-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Tyjae Spears. Irving compares well with Spears. Both are smaller, but tough runners who are excellent receiving backs. They are nearly identical in size and have the ability to be dangerous contributors at the next level.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Tyler Biadasz. Frazier reminds me of Biadasz coming out of Wisconsin. In the NFL, Biadasz turned into a solid starting center for the Cowboys.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Tyron Smith. Team sources have said Mims’ skill set and body are similar to Smith coming out of USC. Smith has been an outstanding offensive tackle for the Cowboys, and if Mims lands with the right team, he has that kind of All-Pro potential as well.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Will Fuller. Worthy is similar to a shorter version of Fuller when Fuller was playing well for the Texans. Both are fast, skinny receivers who bring explosive playmaking. Fuller went in the back half of the first round in the 2016 NFL Draft, and Worthy could go in that range this year. If Worthy pans out, I could see him being similar to Fuller.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Zach Cunningham. Williams reminds me of a more physical version of Cunningham. Both have sideline-to-sideline speed and quality size. They also are skilled in pass coverage for the pro game. Cunningham was a good NFL linebacker for a number of years, and Williams could turn into a similar pro.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Zack Moss. Brooks reminds me of Moss. Both are strong runners who show a surprising burst to go along with receiving ability. Moss was a third-round pick in 2020 and has turned into a solid pro. Brooks could follow a similar path.",1
"Prospect Comparison:;Zay Jones. McMillan has some similarities to Jones in terms of size and dangerous build-up speed. Jones has a quicker release and is better after the catch, but in the NFL, McMillan could become a wideout who is a similar caliber player to Jones.",1

"Quanterus Smith",1
"Quez Watkins",1
"Quincy Enunwa",4
"Quincy Wilson",1
"Quinton Dial",1
"Quinton Dunbar. There are a lot of similarities between Diggs and Dunbar. Dunbar (6-2, 205) is almost identical in size and has some of the same strengths and limitations as Diggs. Both started out playing receiver, but Diggs received more cornerback experience in college than Dunbar, who played wide receiver at Florida. If Diggs pans out in the NFL, I could see him being a corner comparable to Dunbar.",1

"Rashad Jennings.  Gallman reminds me of Jennings. In the NFL, Jennings is a quality backup running back whp is a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none type. Gallman could end up being a similar contributor for his NFL team.;NFL Matches:  Indianapolis, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Tampa Bay, Green Bay, New York Giants, Detroit, New York Jets, Carolina and Minnesota ;There are a lot of teams that could target Gallman in the 2017 NFL Draft. On the second day, there are a lot of teams that may consider taking a running back. The Jets signed Matt Forte, but the skilled veteran is aging. Gallman could help whoever is the Jets next starting quarterback after Josh McCown in Christian Hackenberg or Bryce Petty. ;If Carolina doesn’t take a running back in the first round, the team could consider Gallman to help give Cam Newton more support with a running game. Jonathan Stewart recently turned 30 and has had durability issues throughout his career. ;The Colts, Eagles and Ravens all need long-term starting running backs. Of those three, the Colts could wait the longest given their defensive needs, but Gallman would make sense for Indianapolis in the mid-rounds. Philadelphia with Doug Pederson’s offense would be a good fit for Gallman. Baltimore has tried a few different runners, but needs a lead back to carry its ground game. Tampa Bay could consider taking Gallman given Doug Martin’s situation and his uncertain future with the team. ;In the NFC North, the Packers lost Eddie Lacy this offseason, so they will need a starting running back. The Lions fielded the 30th-ranked rushing offense in 2016, and Ameer Abdullah hasn’t panned out for them thus far. The Vikings need a replacement for Adrian Peterson, and Gallman would be a more talented option than Latavius Murray. ;The Giants had the 29th-ranked rushing offense last season and badly need some talent in the backfield. Gallman would bring some versatility to their run game.",1
"Rashan Gary",1
"Rashan Gary.  Some team sources labelled Morris as a poor man’s Gary. They said Morris is not as talented as Gary and not as keen on being physical or playing the run like Gary, but they are similar in size and both are exceptional athletes. Hence, Morris has upside and could be a lesser version of Gary in the NFL.",1
"Rashard Mendenhall",2
"Rashard Robinson",1
"Rasheem Green",1
"Rasul Douglas",2
"Ray Rice.  Guice’s game is similar to what Rice’s was, plus they are virtually the same size. Like Rice, Guice features quickness to the hole, shifty running with good pad level, and the toughness to pick up yards after contact. Rice was a second-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft, and Guice looks likely to be selected in the same round this year. I think Guice is similar to Rice, and I think Guice could be as good as, or better than, Rice was during his strong seasons from 2009-2012.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, New York Giants, Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, Oakland, Detroit and San Francisco ;There are a lot of teams that could consider taking Guice in the early rounds of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Browns moved on from Isaiah Crowell and signed Carlos Hyde. If they don’t land Saquon Barkley in the first round, Guice would make sense for one of their second-round picks.",1
"Ray Rice.  Weber reminds me of Rice. Rice (5-8, 206) was a compact runner who had strength and quickness. He was a second-round pick in 2008, and Weber could go on Day 2 this year.;NFL Matches:  Oakland, Miami, Washington, Carolina, Houston, Kansas City, Philadelphia ;There are a few teams that could consider taking Weber on the second day of the 2019 NFL Draft. Perhaps the highest that Weber could hope to go would be to Oakland with 34th overall pick. The Raiders need a running back of the future, and Weber would be a good scheme fit for Jon Gruden. ;Miami needs to replace Frank Gore, and Weber could form an excellent tandem with the brittle Kenyan Drake.",1
"Ray Rice. Dixon’s game is similar to Rice’s and they are virtually the same size. Both Dixon and Rice have quickness to the hole, are shifty runners with good pad level and are tough enough to pick up yards after contact. Both backs are very good receivers, too. Rice was a second-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft, and Dixon could be selected on the same day this year. I think Dixon is similar to Rice, but I wouldn’t say he’s more of a poor-man’s version, and I don’t think Dixon will be as good as Rice during his excellent run from 2009-2012.;NFL Matches:  Miami, Houston, New York Jets, Carolina, Arizona, Seattle, Tennessee, Pittsburgh and Chicago",1
"Rayshawn Jenkins",2
"Red Bryant.  Team sources say that Red Bryant is a player who comes to mind when watching Ridgeway. Bryant (6-4, 323) was a massive defensive end, and Ridgeway could be a similar style defender in the NFL.",1
"Reggie Nelson. Nelson is more physical than Bell, but both are good center fielders. Nelson had a career-high eight interceptions last year and has produced quality interception totals in his other seasons. Nelson (5-11, 210) and Bell are almost identical in size. In the NFL, I could see Bell being a coverage safety like Nelson.;NFL Matches:  Pittsburgh, Carolina, Tennessee, San Diego, Miami, Tampa Bay, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Oakland, Indianapolis and Washington",1
"Reshad Jones/Patrick Chung.  Edmunds reminds me of Jones as an ideal strong safety for the current NFL. Jones (6-1, 223) and Edmunds are almost identical in size. They both can cover and are strong run defenders. In the NFL, I could see Edmunds being a Pro Bowl-caliber safety like Jones.",1
"Ricardo Allen.  Some team sources said Molden is similar to Allen. They feel Molden lacks the size and speed to be an every-down slot corner, but he is tough and instinctive, plus has the tackling ability such that he might be able to contribute as an undersized safety, like Allen has in the NFL.",1
"Richard Seymour.  Some team sources have compared Kinlaw to Seymour, which makes sense. They are almost identical in size and both have the versatility defenders to play a variety of techniques up front. Seymour (6-6, 317) had an excellent career for the Patriots and Raiders. Kinlaw has similar potential for his NFL career.",1
"Richard Sherman",1
"Richard Sherman/Charles Woodson.  As a cornerback, Ramsey is a big press-man corner similar to Sherman. As a safety, Ramsey is a rangy play-maker who can cover tight ends and be a play-maker in the middle of the field. I don’t think Ramsey will be as good as Sherman or Woodson, but his style of play is similar to those two star defensive backs. In speaking with former teammate Jameis Winston at the end of Winston’s rookie year, he compared Ramsey to both of those defenders in those roles.;NFL Matches:  Tennessee, San Diego, Jacksonville, Tampa Bay, Chicago, New Orleans and Oakland",1
"Richie Incognito",2
"Richie Incognito.  Hernandez has a similar skill set and style of play to Incognito. After being a third-round pick out of Nebraska, Incognito has been a four-time Pro Bowler. He is a good run blocker and reliable pass protector. Hernandez also should go on the second day of the draft, and I could see him being an NFL blocker similar to Incognito.;NFL Matches:  Denver, Tampa Bay, Chicago, Cincinnati, Seattle, Baltimore, Miami, Dallas, San Francisco, Jacksonville, Indianapolis and Houston ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Hernandez in the 2018 NFL Draft. Denver or Tampa Bay could take Notre Dame guard Quenton Nelson in the first round. Whichever doesn’t land Nelson could target Hernandez in the second round.;Cincinnati definitely needs to improve its offensive line, so Hernandez could be in play for the organization as the true replacement to Kevin Zeitler. Hernandez could help the Bengals establish better run blocking for Joe Mixon. The Bears also could consider looking to get a guard upgrade.",1
"Richie Incognito.  Ingram has a similar skill set and style of play to Incognito. After being a third-round pick out of Nebraska, Incognito became a four-time Pro Bowler. Ingram is a good run blocker and reliable pass protector. He should go on the second day of the 2022 NFL Draft and has the potential to be similar NFL lineman to Incognito.",1
"Ricky Jean-Francois",2
"Ricky Seals-Jones",1
"Ricky Wagner",3
"Riley Reiff.  Reiff (6-6, 319) is bigger than Conklin, but they are similar players. Both are solid blockers who are not overly strong or athletic. Like Reiff, Conklin could struggle with speed rushers. Reiff was a late first-round pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, and Conklin could go in the same range.;NFL Matches:  Miami, Oakland, Detroit, Atlanta, Indianapolis, New York Jets, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Kansas City and Carolina",1
"Robby Anderson",1
"Robby Anderson  Brown reminds me of a shorter version of Anderson. Anderson is a build-up speed deep-threat receiver who ideally is a good No. 2 in the NFL. If Brown pans out in the NFL, I think he could be a receiver similar to Anderson.",2
"Robby Anderson, Martavis Bryant",2
"Robby Anderson.  Hyatt is something like a shorter version of Anderson. Both are fast, skinny receivers who are one-trick ponies. If Hyatt pans out in the NFL, I could see him being a wide receiver similar to Anderson.",1
"Robby Anderson.  Thornton feels like a taller version of Anderson coming out of Temple. Both are fast receivers who are tall and skinny. Anderson has some limitations similar to Thornton. If Thornton pans out, I could see him being a wideout similar to Anderson.",1
"Robert Alford. Gladney reminds me of Robert Alford coming out of Southeastern Louisiana. Gladney is almost identical in size to Alford (5-10, 186), and they have similar cover skills to run with receivers. However, that size is a weakness which teams can exploit. I could see Gladney being a solid pro corner comparable to Alford.",1
"Robert Ayers",1
"Robert Geathers",1
"Robert Griffin III.  Watson and Griffin are similar size signal-callers with excellent athleticism, but both have deficiencies as passers. Both also played in a college point-machine spread offenses that don’t correlate to the NFL. Watson may not get drafted as high as Griffin was, but Watson’s work ethic and character could make him more successful than Griffin as a pro quarterback.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, San Francisco, Chicago, Jacksonville, Buffalo, New Orleans, Los Angeles Chargers, Arizona, Houston, New York Giants, Kansas City and Pittsburgh ;There are a lot of quarterback-needy teams in the NFL, and that will help Watson’s chances of being drafted higher than where he should go. Obviously, the Browns are in dire need of a solution to their quarterback quandary. Cleveland also is loaded with draft picks, including two in the first round, two in the second, and one in the third. Watson could be in play for the Browns with their second first-round pick or the top pick in the second round. Cleveland expressed interest in Watson by asking him to participate in the Senior Bowl. Watson has some similarities to Jared Goff, and that was the quarterback that Hue Jackson wanted for the Browns last year. It wouldn’t be a shock if Watson lands in Cleveland.",1

"Robert Woods",1
"Robert Woods.  Woods (6-0, 190) has almost identical size to Ford. Both of them are quicker than fast wide receivers who should be quality backup contributors. Woods was over-drafted by Buffalo and was a disappointment for them prior to the Rams giving him a huge payday in free agency. I think Ford could be an NFL receiver comparable to Woods.;NFL Matches:  Buffalo, Philadelphia, Tennessee, Tampa Bay, Kansas City, Baltimore, San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles",1
"Robert Woods.  Woods (6-0, 195) and Boutte are almost identical in size and have similar skill sets. Neither is especially dominant in terms of size or speed, but both are polished wide receivers who are solid No. 2 targets. If Boutte lands in the right circumstances, I could see him being a receiver similar to Woods.",1
"Robert Woods.  Woods (6-0, 195) and Metchie are almost identical in size and have similar skill sets. Neither is especially dominant with size or speed, but they are polished receivers who are solid No. 2 targets. If Metchie lands in the right circumstances, he could end up being a receiver similar to Woods.",1
"Rock Ya-Sin",1
"Roddy White.  Jones’ style of play reminds me of Roddy White. White wasn’t the biggest or fastest, but he was quick weapon who ran good routes and generally had reliable hands. In the NFL, it wouldn’t surprise me if Jones ends up being a pro similar to White.;NFL Matches:  Buffalo, Philadelphia, Tennessee, Tampa Bay, Kansas City, Baltimore, Dallas, New England, San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles Rams",1
"Roderick Johnson",1
"Rodger Saffold",1
"Rodger Saffold.  Torrence is a tough player to compare, but he is somewhat reminiscent of Saffold. Saffold (6-5, 325) and Torrence are almost identical in size with serious run-blocking ability while being reliable in pass protection. Saffold had a better body entering the NFL, bringing a little more athleticism and quickness. Torrence has more power and physicality to him. Saffold was the 33rd-overall pick back in 2010, and Torrence could go in the same range this year during the 2023 NFL Draft.",1
"Rodney Hudson.  Hudson has been one of the top centers in the NFL since being a second-round pick in the 2011 NFL Draft. Daniels is nearly the same size as Hudson (6-2, 300), and both are technicians with, quickness, and good athletic skill sets. In the NFL, I could see Daniels being a center comparable to Hudson.;NFL Matches:  Washington, New York Giants, Detroit, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Los Angeles Rams, Tennessee and Los Angeles Chargers ;There are a lot of teams that could consider an upgrade at center. Washington could use help at center, and Daniels would be a nice fit in Jay Gruden’s offense. The Giants lost Weston Richburg in free agency, and if they don’t feel Brett Jones is the long-term answer, they could consider Daniels on Day 2 of the 2018 NFL Draft.",1
"Rodney Hudson. Linderbaum reminds me of Hudson given the speed and athleticism while being a little short and light. Hudson (6-2, 310) was a second-round pick of the Chiefs and has been an excellent pro over the past decade. Linderbaum could be a similar caliber pro.",1
"Rodney Hudson. Ruiz’s playing style reminds me of Hudson’s, and I think Ruiz will be a solid pro, but not quite as good as Hudson. Hudson is more athletic and tougher. Hudson was a second-day pick in 2011, and Ruiz could go on Day 2 this year.",1

Barber (5-9, 180) had a little less size, and like Love, had speed concerns coming out of college. If Love pans out, I could see him being a player whose playing style is comparable to Barber’s, although it isn’t fair to expect Love to be as good as a potential Hall of Fame player in Barber.;NFL Matches:  Tampa Bay, New York Giants, Denver, Washington, Carolina, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Houston, Kansas City, Philadelphia",1
"Ronnie Brown.  Jacobs’ running style and versatility remind me of Brown. Both have quickness, power, a thick build, and receiving ability. Brown was a first-round pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, and Jacobs is a likely first-rounder this year.;NFL Matches:  Miami, Houston, Oakland, Philadelphia, Kansas City, Tampa Bay, Washington ;There are a few teams that could consider taking Jacobs late in the first round or early in the second round during the 2019 NFL Draft. Perhaps the highest that Jacobs could hope to go would be to Miami, which needs to replace Frank Gore. Going 13th overall, however, is high, so Jacobs is probably more of a candidate for the Dolphins if he were to slide to the second round.",1
"Ronnie Harrison",1
"Ronnie Stanely. Sewell is a tough player to compare for the NFL, but he is reminiscent of Stanley (6-6, 315) coming out of Notre Dame.

Watt is the best player in the NFL, so comparing Bosa to him puts unrealistic expectations on Bosa that really aren’t fair. ;In speaking with multiple sources, they say that Bosa is a nearly identical prospect to Kerrigan coming out of Purdue. Both were effective pass-rushers in college and also good run defenders. Athletically, they have good, well-rounded skill sets.

They both have some flaws, which make them good, but not elite, quarterbacks.

Obviously, the Browns are in dire need of a solution to their quarterback quandary. Cleveland also is loaded with draft picks, including two in the first round, two in the second and one in the third. Trubisky could be in play for the Browns with their second first-round pick. They also could consider trading up from No. 33 if they take other players at No. 1 and No. 12.

"Sean Smith.  There are some similarities between Jackson and Smith. They both have a mix of size, ball skills and coverage ability. Early on in his career, Smith was prone to taking some risks that caused him to give up some plays, but he has become more disciplined. Smith (6-3, 218) is a good cornerback, and Jackson could turn into that in the NFL. The Dolphins drafted Smith out of Utah in the second round of the 2009 NFL Draft.

Dallas could use more linebacker talent, and Jefferson could give the team a long-term complement to go with Jaylon Smith. The Lions could target Jefferson as a linebacker to go with Jarrad Davis, but Detroit probably has bigger needs to address on Day 2. ;Among the playoff teams, Jefferson has a number of potential fits. Buffalo lost Preston Brown in free agency and is desperate at linebacker. Jefferson could be a fit for the Bills on Day 2. ;An inside linebacker is a need for the Titans, and Jefferson would be a good fit for Mike Vrabel. Minnesota could use a linebacker to go with Erik Kendricks and Anthony Barr. ;Linebacker is one of the biggest needs for the Saints. Jefferson would be a great fit in the New Orleans defense as he could be a perfect Will – weak side – linebacker next to Alex Anzalone in the middle. ;Pittsburgh has a big hole at inside linebacker in the wake of Ryan Shazier’s injury. Even if Shazier comes back in 2019, the Steelers could use an upgrade next to him. The Patriots could stand to improve their linebacker talent next to Dont’a Hightower. New England has multiple second-round picks, so grabbing a linebacker is very possible for the organization.;If the Eagles trade back from the first round and add more second-day picks, they could consider Jefferson. Going back to college at Texas, Jordan Hicks has been a good player when healthy but has dealt with a steady string of injuries. ;Indianapolis badly needs to improve its linebacking corps, and Jefferson could give the team a long-term defensive building block.

"Trent Brown. Multiple team sources have said Becton is a quicker, more athletic version of Brown. Considering Brown is one of the top tackles in the NFL, that is high praise for Becton. Becton could be a better version of Brown as a pro.",1
"Trent Green",1
"Trent Williams",2
"Trevon Young",1
"Trey Flowers.  In some ways, Greenard reminds me of Flowers. Neither player is dominant from a size and speed perspective, but they both have a natural ability to get after the quarterback. Flowers (6-2, 265) and Greenard are almost identical in size with similar speed, strengths and limitations.",1
"Trey Hendrickson.  Karlaftis reminds me of Hendrickson as a pass rusher. Hendrickson (6-4, 270) and Karlaftis are almost identical in size, and run-defense issues caused Hendrickson to slide to the third round before the Saints wisely drafted him. In the NFL, I could see Karlaftis being a defensive end similar to Hendrickson.",1
"Trey Pipkins",1
"Tre’Davious White.  In speaking to team sources, they say that Baker is similar to White, although slower. White was a star SEC cornerback before going as a first-round pick of the Bills in the 2017 NFL Draft. Since the start of his rookie year, White has been a good cover corner for Buffalo, and those scouts think Baker could be a similar caliber corner in the NFL.;NFL Matches:  New York Giants, Denver, Washington, Carolina, Tennessee, Pittsburgh, Houston, Oakland, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Arizona, Tampa Bay",1
"Trumaine Johnson",3
"Trumaine Johnson. Some team sources said Jaylon Johnson reminds them of Trumaine Johnson. Trumaine Johnson (6-2, 210) was a second-day pick of the St. Louis Rams in the 2012 NFL Draft out of Montana. If Jaylon Johnson can add some weight, he could be a corner comparable to Trumaine Johnson.",1
"Trysten Hill",1
"Tye Smith",1
"Tyler Allgeier.  Some team sources have compared Charbonnet to Allgeier. However, they said Charbonnet is like a taller and more athletic version of Allgeier. Allgeier was an excellent late-round pick by the Falcons, but Charbonnet should go earlier than that in the 2023 NFL Draft.",1
"Tyler Biadasz. Patterson compares well with Biadasz coming out of Wisconsin. They both were solid interior blockers who had a slide in the final months before their draft. Biadasz (6-4, 316) and Patterson are almost identical in size, and both have some athletic limitations. However, both are tough, smart technicians. Biadasz has turned into a good pro, and I could see Patterson being a similar caliber player.",1

"Tyrann Mathieu",1
"Tyrann Mathieu.  Pitre is a unique player, and thereby he is hard to compare. His style of play is similar to Mathieu’s in that Pitre is dangerous in underneath zone, can blitz, and make some splash plays while being undersized. Mathieu, however, can do a lot of things that Pitre can’t. Mathieu is more instinctive, tougher in run defense, and has the ability to play man coverage on slot receivers or tight ends. Pitre can’t do those things, so in the NFL, Pitre might be a poor man’s version of Mathieu.",1
"Tyrann Mathieu.  Some sources have told me they think that Fitzpatrick is a bigger version of Mathieu. The instincts, play-making skills, versatility, and being a mismatch eraser are why they felt that Fitzpatrick is similar to Mathieu.;NFL Matches:  Cleveland, Tampa Bay, San Francisco, Oakland, Washington, Los Angeles Chargers, Seattle and Dallas ;There probably isn’t a head coach, general manager, or defensive coordinator in the NFL who wouldn’t want Fitzpatrick on their team. Thus, many teams without a perceived safety need could consider taking him.",1
"Tyrann Mathieu. Some team sources said McKinney reminded them of Mathieu except McKinney is bigger, taller, and did not make as many splash plays as Mathieu in college. Both, however, are dynamic in coverage with ability to play a variety of positions and techniques to erase mismatches and solve coverage problems.",1
"Tyre Phillips",1
"Tyreek Hill",1
"Tyreek Hill  Multiple team sources compared Waddle to Hill. Hill (5-10, 185) and Waddle are almost identical in size and possess game-breaking speed and explosiveness that make them nearly impossible to cover. If Waddle stays healthy and lands with a good team like Hill did, Waddle could be Hill-type receiver in the NFL.",1
"Tyreek Hill/Brandin Cooks  Robinson drew some interesting comparisons from team sources, with the names of Tyreek Hill and Cooks being compared to Robinson. They noted Robinson is not as fast as Hill (5-10, 185), but Robinson is a better route runner than Hill entering the NFL. It makes sense as Robinson and Hill are also almost identical in size with slippery quickness that makes them nearly impossible to cover. Some sources said they think Robinson will be a better version of Cooks in the NFL.",1
"Tyrell Williams  Marshall and Williams (6-4, 205) are almost identical in size and have the speed to challenge defenses downfield. Williams went undrafted after falling under the radar at Western Oregon, but he had some good seasons with the Chargers. In the NFL, I could see Marshall being similar to Williams and having the upside to be a better version.",1
"Tyrell Williams  There are a lot of similarities between Higgins and Williams. They are nearly identical in size, and Williams (6-4, 205) also is a receiver who thrives outside the numbers. While he has size, Williams is not a bully or very physical. Higgins could become an NFL receiver similar to Williams.",1
"Tyron Smith.  Smith came into the NFL with rare athleticism and quickness as an offensive tackle. He has turned into an excellent left tackle for the Cowboys after being a top-10 pick in the 2011 NFL Draft. In the NFL, I could see Tunsil being a player similar to Smith.;NFL Matches:  Tennessee, San Diego, Jacksonville, San Francisco, Miami and Tampa Bay",1
"Tyrone Crawford",1
"Tyrone Crawford.  Clemons reminds me of Crawford coming out of Boise State. Both are physical, tough defenders with quality size. Crawford contributed somewhat to the edge rush, but was never a prolific pass rusher in the NFL. Clemons could be a similar pro. Crawford was a third-round pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, and Clemons could end up a third-round choice this year in the 2022 NFL Draft.",1
"Tyson Alualu",1
"Tyson Campbell. Ringo is akin to a thinner Campbell, but slightly slower and more stiff than Campbell. Both are big corners who can play press man and defend big receivers. Ringo could do that as well in the NFL. In the 2021 NFL Draft, Campbell was a high second-round pick, and Ringo could be a late first-rounder or second-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft.",1

"Vernon Davis.  A lot of scouts have said that Njoku is a better version of Eric Ebron and have also compared Njoku to Davis. In my opinion, the latter comparison is a better fit. Davis was an athletic freak coming out of Maryland and has put together a good career with some excellent years for the 49ers and a bounce-back season with the Redskins. Davis and Njoku are almost identical in size with excellent speed and athleticism.;NFL Matches:  Tennessee, Tampa Bay, Denver, Houston, New York Giants, Pittsburgh and Jacksonville",1
"Vernon Gholston.  In some ways, Rousseau reminds me of Gholston, who was a mega bust for the Jets after being sixth-overall pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. Gholston put up a big season of sack production at Ohio State but lacked speed for the NFL. I think Rousseau could be overrated and possesses bust potential similar to Gholston.",1

"Vince Mayle",1
"Vince Wilfork",1
"Vincent Jackson  There are a lot of similarities between Claypool and Jackson. They are big wide receivers who provide a size mismatch while also being faster than expected. In the NFL, I could see Claypool being a receiver similar to Jackson, provided Claypool pans out.",1
"Vincent Jackson, Darren Waller",1
"Vincent Jackson.  St. Brown is a thinner version of Jackson. However after some time in a pro strength and conditioning program, St. Brown could end up being similar size to Jackson (6-5, 230), who is only 15 pounds away. St. Brown’s combination of size, quickness, and route-running present a lot of mismatch problems just like Jackson did during his prime years in San Diego. Jackson was a second-round pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, and St. Brown could go on Day 2 this year.;NFL Matches:  Chicago, San Francisco, Miami, Arizona, Green Bay, Dallas, Baltimore, Dallas, Carolina, New Orleans and Jacksonville ;There are a lot of teams that could be in the market for a wide receiver upgrade in the 2018 NFL Draft. The Bears and 49ers both could consider more receiving talent. Chicago signed two receivers for Mitch Trubisky, but the team could use more talent. The Bears have shown interest in St. Brown, who would make sense for them. St. Brown would be a great fit for Kyle Shanahan’s offense across from Marquise Goodwin. With the 49ers, St. Brown could evolve into a No. 1 receiver, and he would be a great fit for San Francisco late in the second round or early in Round 3. ;In the teens, there are a lot of potential landing spots for St. Brown. The Dolphins could consider bringing St. Brown to South Florida as they need to replace Jarvis Landry. ;Green Bay could use more receiving talent after moving on from Jordy Nelson. St. Brown would be a nice fit in the Packers’ offense. He could become a potent receiver for the sunset seasons of Aaron Rodgers career. On Day 2, St. Brown would make a lot of sense for Green Bay. ;The Cowboys cut Dez Bryant and could use more talent at receiver. St. Brown would be a nice fit for Dallas on Day 2 of the 2018 NFL Draft. ;Arizona has to consider life after Larry Fitzgerald and could use more receiving talent around the future Hall of Famer. If the Cardinals land a quarterback in the first round, St. Brown could be a fit for them on Day 2. ;The Ravens need more talent at receiver, and St. Brown could be a weapon across from Michael Crabtree.",1

Mercilus (6-4, 258) and Jackson are almost identical in size with the ability to drop into coverage and play in space. Mercilus was a late first-round pick by the Texans and turned into an excellent pro. Jackson might not end up as good as Mercilus was at his peak, but if Jackson pans out he could be a similar style defender to Mercilus.",2
"Will Fuller",1
"Will Fuller.  Ruggs reminds me of Fuller coming out of Notre Dame in 2015. Both have elite speed and can be devastating play-makers. Fuller (6-0, 184) and Ruggs are almost identical in size with game-breaking speed.",1
"Will Fuller/Hollywood Brown/Henry Ruggs.  NFL team sources compared Williams to Fuller, Brown and Ruggs. Here is what one director of player personnel said about Williams, “He’s more like Henry Ruggs than Jaylen Waddle. Williams is more linear than Waddle. He is more similar to Will Fuller, but not as good of a route runner as Fuller. Williams has serious speed, like Ruggs, but Williams has more feel and football sense than Ruggs. Jameson could be a longer Hollywood Brown.”",2

They also have ball skills, physicality, and the ability to play man-to-man. Howard was a high second-round pick in 2016, and Robinson could go in the same region this year. In the NFL, I could see Robinson being a corner similar to Howard in the NFL but perhaps not quite as good.",1
"Xavier Rhodes. Campbell reminds me of a thinner Rhodes. Rhodes (6-1, 218) is a big corner who can play press man and defend big receivers. Campbell could do that as well in the NFL.

"Yannick Ngakoue.  Team sources have compared Ebiketie to Ngakoue, which is a comparison that makes a lot of sense.

"Zach Brown.  In conversations with team scouts, they have compared Evans to Zach Brown. They say that Evans is not as fast or rangy as Brown, but Evans is more physical. Brown had a slow start to his career with Tennessee, but that was the fault of the coaching staff as Brown quickly became a good linebacker for the Bills and Redskins. In the NFL, I could see Evans being similar to Brown. NFL Matches:  Dallas, Detroit, Buffalo, Tennessee, New Orleans, Minnesota, Pittsburgh, New England, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, San Francisco, Oakland, Miami and Green Bay ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Evans in the 2018 NFL Draft. On the first night of the draft, there are a few teams that could consider Evans in the back half of the first round. Dallas could use more linebacker talent, and Evans could give the Cowboys a long-term complement to go with Jaylon Smith. The Lions could target Evans as a linebacker to go with Jarrad Davis, but it seems unlikely Detroit would take a linebacker in the first round two years in a row. ;Among the playoff teams, Evans has a number of potential fits. Buffalo lost Preston Brown in free agency, and if the Bills don’t trade away their pick at No. 22, they could consider Evans. An inside linebacker is a need for the Titans and Evans would be a good fit for Mike Vrabel. Linebacker is one of the biggest needs for the Saints. Evans would be a great fit in the New Orleans defense as he could be a perfect Will – weakside – linebacker next to Alex Anzalone in the middle. ;Minnesota could use a linebacker to go with Erik Kendricks and Anthony Barr. Pittsburgh has a big hole at inside linebacker in the wake of Ryan Shazier’s injury. Even if Shazier comes back in 2019, the Steelers could use an upgrade next to him. The Patriots could stand to improve their linebacker talent next to Dont’a Hightower. Philadelphia also could look to improve its linebackers with Evans. Going back to college at Texas, Jordan Hicks has been a good player when healthy, but has dealt with a steady string of injuries. ;Early in the second round, there are a lot of possible landing spots for Evans. Indianapolis badly needs to improve its linebacking corps, and Evans would give the Colts a long-term defensive building block. ;The 49ers could consider taking Evans. Given all the problems that Reuben Foster has had off the field, along with dealing a lot of injuries, Evans could interest John Lynch as the long-term Mike – middle – linebacker to build the San Francisco defense around. Even if Foster returns to the field, Evans could be a tough middle linebacker with Foster serving as the Will. ;The Raiders have to improve the middle of their defense and the front seven. Evans would be an upgrade to their rush defense and pass coverage. He would give them an upgrade at middle linebacker. The Dolphins released Lawrence Timmons and need to improve their linebackers. Green Bay also could consider a linebacker upgrade next to Blake Martinez.",1
"Zach Cunningham",1
"Zach Cunningham.  Davis compare well with Cunningham in terms of his size and speed. Cunningham( 6-3, 238) and Davis are almost identical in size and have the speed and the athleticism to be assets in pass coverage. Cunningham needed to get better at taking on shedding and blocks coming out of Vanderbilt as well. Cunningham was an astute second-round pick in the 2017 NFL Draft by the Rick Smith-led Texans that drafted Deshaun Watson a round earlier. Davis could be a similar steal as a late first-round or second-round pick in the 2021 NFL Draft.",1
"Zach Cunningham.  Multiple team sources say Clark is similar to Cunningham. Both have sideline-to-sideline speed and are tackling machines as run defenders. They also are skilled in pass coverage. Cunningham has been an excellent NFL linebacker, and Clark could turn into a similar pro.",1
"Zach Cunningham.  Some team sources have compared Lloyd to Cunningham, which makes a lot of sense. Cunningham and Lloyd are both 6-foot-3 and nearly identical in size. They are also both instinctive run defenders with the ability to cover. Cunningham was a second-round pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, and Lloyd could in the second round this year. I could see Lloyd being a similar pro defender to Cunningham.",1
"Zach Ertz",2
"Zach Ertz.  Hockenson and Ertz (6-5, 250) are almost identical in size and have similar athleticism. Both possess speed and agility to go with their frames. They also have blocking ability to go along with being receiving threats. If Hockenson pans out, I think he could be a tight end similar to Ertz.;NFL Matches:  Jacksonville, Detroit, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, Los Angeles Chargers, New England,;The Jaguars could use a long-term starting tight end because they let Austin Seferian-Jenkins go. Hockenson would provide a weapon for Nick Foles and help Jacksonville run the ball with Leonard Fournette.",1
"Zach Ertz.  Hurst and Ertz (6-5, 250) are almost identical in size and have similar athleticism. Both possess speed and agility to go with their frames. They also have blocking ability to go along with being receiving threats. Ertz was a second-round pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, and Hurst could easily go in that round in 2018.;NFL Matches:  Pittsburgh, Miami, Baltimore, Green Bay, New England, Jacksonville and Houston ;There are a lot of teams that could be a fit for Hurst in the first few rounds of the 2018 NFL Draft. Perhaps the highest that he could hope to go would be to the Steelers at the end of the first round. Pittsburgh needs a tight end upgrade and is in win-now mode, so Hurst’s age may not be an issue for the organization.",1
"Zach Ertz. Freiermuth’s style of play reminds me of Ertz coming out of Stanford. Both were receiving weapons with the ability to contribute as blockers. They are almost identical in size, and Ertz (6-5, 250) turned into a good three-down starter. Ertz was a second-round pick in 2013, and Freiermuth could go in the same round in the 2021 NFL Draft.",1
"Zach Ertz. Hooper reminds me of a shorter version of Ertz. Both are quality blockers and dangerous seam receivers. For the Eagles, Ertz has turned into quality weapon in the passing game. Ertz was a second-round pick of the Eagles in the 2013 NFL Draft, and Hooper could go in the same range of the 2016 NFL Draft.;NFL Matches:  Atlanta, Los Angeles, Green Bay, Houston, Indianapolis and Chicago",1
"Zach Ertz. LaPorta reminds me of Ertz. Both are natural receivers with good hands, run-after-the-catch ability, and functional blocking. Ertz was a second-day pick in his draft class, and LaPorta could go on Day 2 of the 2023 NFL Draft.",1
"Zach Ertz. Otton’s natural receiving ability is similar to Ertz’s. Ertz was more productive in college, perhaps due to playing in better circumstances, but if Otton pans out, I could see him a tight end similar to Ertz.",1

Martin was said to have an arm length of 32.25 inches, and Skoronski’s arm is said to be 32 inches long. Martin has been an excellent pro and was a plug-and-play starter after being a mid-first-rounder.
