Will be very difficult for opposing defenders to slow down due to his ability to create offense with the ball in his hands.

He was a McDonald's All American and four-time participant at USA Basketball camps, gagnant a gold medaille at the FIBA U17 World Cup and bronze at the U19 World Cup. After playing point guard early in his career, Quickley largely came off the bench as a freshman behind Ashton Hagans and Tyler Herro, and spent much of his time off the ball as a sophomore as part of a three-guard lineup with Hagans and projected lottery pick Tyrese Maxey.Quickley has good size for a guard at 6-foot-3 with a 6-foot-10 wingspan that helped him emerge as one of the best defenders in the college game. His ability to slow down guards, wings and forwards alike was a key part of the Wildcats' success this season, along with his excellent perimeter shooting.

Pritchard moves well off the ball, has excellent shot preparation and is an efficient catch-and-shoot marksman. He's a pull-up threat once he crosses half court. He's also a greatly improved finisher with all the veteran tricks.  On defense, Pritchard is hard-nosed and sturdy enough to hold his own, even with teams likely to seek him out as a rookie. The 22-year-old senior shows similarities to Toronto's Fred VanVleet as a tough, ground-bound guard with the knack for timely shots. Jalen Brunson is another name that comes to mind when evaluating Pritchard. Like VanVleet has done alongside Kyle Lowry and Brunson to a lesser degree next to Luka Doncic, I'd expect Pritchard to emerge as an under-drafted overachiever who can fit next to another accomplished guard on a playoff team.

Perry put up big numbers during his sophomore season at Mississippi State, averaging 17.4 points, 10.1 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.2 blocks per game in 31 minutes, but he did a lot of his damage in the paint and was spotty with decision-making and defensive impact.

Detractors, especially in analytics departments, point to his age, diminutive size, and inconsistent shooting indicators, which ultimately caused him to fall out of the top-10. There is little doubt that Mitchell's explosive ability, high-intensity level defensively and much-improved playmaking ability will get him on the floor early in his career, which surely played a major role in being selected here. Their backcourt looks a little bit crowded tonight, with Buddy Hield still in the fold (but maybe not for long), but this is a team that should be looking to stockpile as much talent as possible. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They have the financial flexibility to add pieces, either in free agency or trades, and should continue to grow organically as Morant gains strength, improves his shooting and develops more chemistry with his teammates through continuity. That flexibility became immediately evident with the trade they made to move up from the No. 17 spot to No. 10, taking on salary commitment in the form of Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe and landing a 2022 first-round pick by way of the Lakers. The Grizzlies front office has been reshaped from being the butt of many jokes around the NBA to a force to be reckoned with in the past few years, and they will likely continue to make savvy moves around the edges to build around Morant and make even more progress in the win column. Ziaire Williams started the season projected as a top-5 pick but saw his stock drop after a disappointing, disjointed campaign at Stanford. He was able to rebound from that in the pre-draft process by showing his significant talent in workouts, and measuring a hair under 6-foot-10 in shoes, giving him tremendous size to go along with elite-level shot-making prowess.

He looks like a strong fit playing off Ball with his sweet-shooting stroke and terrific cutting ability. To reach his potential, Bouknight will need to show better ability as a passer, shooter and defender than he did in his up and down two seasons at UConn, where we may not have seen the full extent of his talent due to injury. At times he dropped flashes of offensive brilliance that carried over into a strong pre-draft process and helped him establish himself as a lottery pick.

The team has missed the playoffs two consecutive seasons for the first time in franchise history. Rather than try to put a bandaid on what ails them, the Spurs went with the best player available selection, swinging for the fences with the youngest prospect in the draft.

"ESPN","Paolo Banchero",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Duke","DUKE","There really isn't much Banchero can't do on either end of the floor. Unlike the other two candidates for the No. 1 pick, Chet Holmgren and Jabari Smith, Banchero projects as the type of NBA player a team can run their offense through right off the bat early or late in the shot-clock, soaking up a significant number of possessions and be reasonably efficient in the process, while also keeping teammates happy. Banchero is equally comfortable creating from the high, mid, or low post. He can play pick and roll, go one-on-one, is breathtaking pushing off the defensive glass, and is an extremely skilled finisher thanks to his polished footwork, smooth body control, extraordinary touch around the basket and creativity using either hand. Banchero's strength allows him to operate effectively through contact and draw plenty of fouls, but he's also an impressive passer who shows strong vision dishing off a live dribble. Banchero is also a capable shooter, averaging one 3-pointer per game, 77% of his free throw attempts, and a significant volume of mid-range jumpers and difficult short range attempts demonstrating his soft touch as a scorer that bodes well for his chances of extending his range and becoming more consistent from the perimeter in time.  At 6-foot-10, 250 pounds, with exceptional scoring instincts, versatility and feel for the game, Banchero won't need any time at all to transition to the NBA either physically or skill wise. Defensively, he's more than capable one-on-one, has the strength to hold his ground effectively versus power forwards and centers alike, and is switchable on the perimeter thanks to his good feet and solid instincts. His energy comes and goes, but when engaged, he does some very impressive things sliding his feet versus smaller players, putting a body on bigger guys inside, and making plays getting in passing lanes or protecting the rim that suggest he could be outstanding if he brought a more consistent level of intensity on every possession.  The fact that we're not talking about him as the sure-fire No. 1 pick speaks to the strength of this class. ","While NBA teams all uniformly love Banchero's talent, some have question marks about how much his style of play will translate to winning, at least early in his career if he doesn't improve his shortcomings. Banchero doesn't always bring the level of engagement you might hope on either end of the floor in terms of the consistency of his approach. He can be a ball-stopper who tends to let defenders off the hook by settling for difficult shots in the mid-range, doesn't always play with the type of physicality you might hope, and has some lazy habits off the ball defensively that better teams in the ACC have punished for easy points.  While Banchero has been dealing with pretty cramped spacing at times, playing alongside a traditional center with several streaky shooters in the backcourt, his efficiency has really waned against Top-100 competition, where he's shooting under 50% from 2-point range, 30% from 3 and posting more turnovers than assists. The player we saw in early November in the Champions Classic against Kentucky, and then in one of the most spectacular halves of the season versus Gonzaga, hasn't been there as vividly in-conference play. It's very possible that the high-stakes of the NCAA Tournament brings back that same level of engagement from Banchero we saw early in the season, which would put him squarely back in the conversation for the No. 1 pick, which he's faded from somewhat over the past few months. Comps at the next level (ceiling/floor): Julius Randle and prime Blake Griffin (a perennial All-Star and five-time All-NBA player prior to injuries) are comparisons you hear most often associated with Banchero -- more so due to their style of play now and less than how they played in college. Banchero is not nearly as explosive as Griffin was at his peak, but was also far more skilled from the perimeter at the same age, which can similarly be said in comparison with Randle, who also didn't start shooting 3s in earnest until his fifth NBA season. Those comparisons hint at some of the questions Banchero might face defensively early in his career, especially in the small-ball era where teams will likely want to see him play fairly significant minutes at center. Chris Webber is another comparison teams may point to skill-wise, although he played in a different era in which NBA big men didn't shoot 3-pointers as today's game. Optimal/practical NBA team fits: Banchero's ability to play both power forward or center, and operate equally effectively on the perimeter or the paint makes him an easy player to fit onto almost any NBA roster. The Detroit Pistons would be an excellent fit for Banchero, pairing him with a fellow cornerstone backcourt player in Cade Cunningham with some good young pieces to play alongside in Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart. Orlando is another, as he's versatile enough to play alongside either Wendell Carter, Jr. or Mo Bamba, while providing another playmaker to pair with Cole Anthony, Jalen Suggs and Franz Wagner. Houston would likely have a great deal of interest as well, as he could bring a great deal of firepower alongside either Christian Wood or Alperen Sengun, bringing the type of physical inside presence the team currently lacks. Indiana could very well be in the market for another frontcourt scoring option after trading Domantas Sabonis for Tyrese Haliburton. Oklahoma City has very little scoring prowess in the frontcourt and would likely have a great deal of interest in Banchero's ability to create offense and also finish plays around the basket.  -- Jonathan Givony",NA,"April 6, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Where they rank following the Final Four) -- Banchero's outstanding freshman campaign came to end against North Carolina with the projected top-3 NBA pick turning in a 20-point, 10-rebound performance that was very representative of his clear strengths and glaring improvement areas.  On the offensive end, Banchero showed flashes of brilliance. He knocked down a pair of decisive trail 3s (one off the catch and one off the bounce), used his powerful 250-pound frame to attack the rim rather than settle for contested pull-ups, and finished post-ups over Brady Manek and Armando Bacot. Banchero scoring 20 points on 17 shots against a below average defender in Manek isn't going to convince NBA teams that he should be the No. 1 pick. The fact that he did struggle a bit to finish over length at times is noteworthy when you consider his good -- not great -- reach (he shot 49% from 2 in the NCAA tournament). Not scoring a bucket over the last 7:37 is also something naysayers will point to. The 19-year-old still showed yet again how much of a mismatch he is for opposing defenses, which should surely translate well with NBA spacing. It was Banchero's spotty defensive effort that will likely stick with NBA scouts. UNC had a clear plan to bring Banchero into action after action to force a switch and attack him. Banchero held up OK in these situations despite getting caught a little flat-footed on a couple occasions, even blocking R.J. Davis at the rim after a switch. He also added some value as a defensive rover when he was defending Leaky Black as he started the game fairly disruptive, and altered a shot at the rim as the drop defender in the second half. Banchero had some head-scratching possessions that didn't help ease concerns about his conditioning and his willingness to play with consistent energy on defense. He looked tired and heavy-footed jogging back in transition, failing to stop the ball when in position a couple of times, and looking lethargic as Manek looped around for a lightly-contested 3. Banchero didn't even attempt to get a hand up on two Davis pull-ups, one coming after a switch toward the end of the first half. His consistency on the defensive glass remains a major work in progress for Banchero as well. With Williams and Theo John in foul trouble and Banchero at the 5 for a quick spurt down the stretch, Bacot drew two quick fouls in the post. Being able to slide up to the 5 at the next level is a big part of Banchero's intrigue, and he didn't offer much in terms of defensive rebounding or rim protection with Duke's season on the line. The now-former Duke star isn't the first potential No. 1 pick to not exactly bring it on every defensive possession. Defensive motor is quite regularly a concern for top prospects, particularly perimeter players. And overall, Banchero's NCAA tournament run should be considered a success, as he averaged 18.8 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 3.4 assists while shooting 53% from 3 over five games. He's the most polished of the potential top-3 picks and a strong candidate to compete for Rookie of the Year pending his potential new team. But for the teams that were already concerned about Banchero's defensive impact -- preferring the two-way play of Jabari Smith and Chet Holmgren -- Saturday's heartbreaking loss to UNC likely didn't help change their mind. -- Mike Schmitz March 28, 2022: (Final Four week mock draft) -- Banchero, the only top-seven prospect still playing, had another outstanding NCAA tournament weekend to help guide Duke to the Final Four, where a rematch with archrival North Carolina awaits. He posted 38 points, 11 rebounds and 7 assists through two games, shouldering a significant role offensively in key moments and mostly breaking free of the tentativeness that plagued him early in the season.  Banchero continued to make a compelling case as the most dangerous shot-creator in this draft class. At 6-foot-10, few can match his combination of strength, footwork and polish in the post, outstanding ballhandling, fluidity and skill creating his own shot on the perimeter -- as he has made 8 of 15 3-pointers and several midrange pull-up jumpers through four NCAA tournament games. Most impressive has been the way Banchero creates good looks for teammates off a live dribble, making several stunning reads when defenders collapse on his isolation attempts or while pushing off the defensive glass in the open court. Having the ability to shoulder a significant offensive load and consistently create high-percentage shots for himself and others is perhaps the most valuable skill a bad NBA team can target, helping him surpass Jabari Smith at No. 2 and giving Banchero a clear avenue to being the No. 1 pick in the draft, depending on which team is fortunate enough to land it. Defensively is where Banchero's fit is a little murkier. His energy and focus fluctuates, as he had some bad possessions guarding the pick-and-roll, was slow to rotate several times to the paint and was clearly the weakest link in Duke's zone while not offering much as a rebounder. With which type of big man a team should pair him and how many minutes he can shoulder as a small-ball center are still open question marks. But 38 games into the season, Banchero's strengths and weaknesses are well-known, and it was noteworthy for scouts to learn more about his basketball character. His willingness to step up in key moments and deliver clutch baskets and assists against two of the top defensive teams in college basketball in Texas Tech and Arkansas was significant from a draft perspective. Banchero can continue to build his candidacy as the No. 1 pick in the draft with another strong weekend at the Final Four in New Orleans. -- Jonathan Givony March 21, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Where they rank following first weekend of NCAA tournament) -- Banchero had some ups and downs but played a huge role in Duke's comeback win over Michigan State, making several important plays down the stretch. Despite looking indecisive at times in the first half, Banchero ramped up the aggression and unleashed his talent in a major way with several skillful one-on-one baskets in the final minutes, scoring on a fluid, rangy spin-move from the perimeter over Marcus Bingham Jr., and then powering through Joey Hauser with a series of crossovers and hesitation moves to give the Blue Devils the lead for good.  Banchero also showed his ability to find teammates for open shots, and had an impressive block on Hauser -- sliding his feet on the perimeter and meeting him at the rim -- showing excellent mobility and timing on the defensive end. Banchero's tendency to overthink open jumpers and shy away from physicality on both ends of the floor has been frustrating for scouts to watch at times this season, but there was very little to criticize in this game as he finished with 19 points, seven rebounds, four assists and a trip to the Sweet 16. Duke will face the No. 1 defensive team in college basketball, Texas Tech, which should provide a major test for coach Mike Krzyzewski's young squad. -- Jonathan Givony March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- No player offers the same type of size, strength and shot creation that Duke star Banchero brings to the table at 6-foot-10 and 250 pounds. With legitimate guard skills that allow him to initiate Duke's offense in transition and function as a pick-and-roll ball handler in the half court, Banchero is a true mismatch nightmare, comparing favorably to post-injury Blake Griffin with his combination of power, agility and court vision. When Banchero is rolling offensively, few players are tougher to defend, which he showed the entire country in Madison Square Garden against Kentucky (22 points on 11 shots) and in a win over Gonzaga's Holmgren, scoring 21 points by way of pull-up 3s, step-back jumpers, crossover pull-ups, powerful drives and mid-post turnarounds. One of the most prolific isolation players in the NCAA, Banchero has an NBA-ready offensive bag.  What version of Banchero will show up? Will it be the ultra-confident potential No. 1 pick who looked unfazed by the pressure of MSG or the player who looked tentative down the stretch of a few Duke losses during conference play? Will Banchero buy into a more free-flowing style that accentuates his pass-dribble-shoot skill set or will his catch-and-hold tendencies show up again during important games? Scouts will have a close eye on Banchero's defensive intensity and off-ball awareness, as his inconsistency on that end of the floor is a big reason why he has taken a back seat to two-way prospects such as Holmgren and Smith. Banchero is the type of offensive talent who can take over a game, and doing so when it matters most would be a great way to remind NBA executives why he was once considered the early favorite for the No. 1 pick. Scouts will surely be hoping for a deep run from Duke and Gonzaga, as that would set up a Banchero-Holmgren rematch in the Elite 8. -- Mike Schmitz February 25, 2022: (Projecting Duke players) -- ","Orlando's decision to flip the switch and enter rebuilding mode with the trades of Nikola Vucevic and Aaron Gordon has netted them several intriguing young prospects and allowed them to lose enough games to land the No. 1 pick. The Magic have quite a bit of talent at almost every position, but no one sure-fire All-Star caliber player they can point to yet, which makes this an important turning point in the front office's tenure. Getting a better handle on the team hierarchy, both in the backcourt with Cole Anthony, Markelle Fultz and Jalen Suggs all overlapping to some degree, and the frontcourt, where Jonathan Isaac's return looms with the emergence of Franz Wagner, will be important in where this pick slots into the pecking order of this deep, talented young roster. A bevy of cap space this summer provides further flexibility for a franchise that could become a real player in the Eastern Conference in the coming years if they nail the final stages of their rebuild.  Orlando surprised most of the league by electing to draft Paolo Banchero first, without the benefit of a private workout or visit to their city. The Magic did interview Banchero at the NBA draft combine and ultimately decided he is the best prospect in the draft and the player worth investing the top pick in. Banchero projects as the type of NBA player a team can run their offense through right off the bat early or late in the shot-clock, soaking up a significant number of possessions and be reasonably efficient in the process, while also keeping teammates happy. A 6-10, 250-pound, shot-creating dynamo who can carry a significant load with his ability to handle, pass and shoot, there really isn't much Banchero can't do on either end of the floor. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Chet Holmgren",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gonzaga","GONZ",NA,NA,NA,"March 28, 2022: (Final Four week mock draft) -- Three dubious foul calls in the second half brought Holmgren's college career to an end against Arkansas, as he was forced to watch the final 3.5 minutes of his team's season from the bench.  Holmgren sat most of the first half, as well, with foul trouble, only playing 23 minutes in total, during which he still posted 11 points, 14 rebounds, 2 blocks and was the only Gonzaga player to finish with a positive plus/minus, an indication of his impact and how much the referees' decision to disqualify him hurt his team's chances of advancing. He showed flashes of his skill level, draining a pair of jump shots, creating from the perimeter, making several resourceful passes, crashing the offensive glass aggressively and, as usual, challenging countless shots in the paint. Still, it's hard not to feel like Holmgren had more to give on the offensive end, as Gonzaga's game plan centered around Drew Timme post-ups and Andrew Nembhard ball screens, with Holmgren usually acting as a complementary floor spacer. Both Timme and especially Nembhard had off nights, which ended up spelling Gonzaga's demise. It's likely we'll see Holmgren in a different role in the NBA, without a traditional back-to-the-basket big man clogging up the paint on every drive, allowing Holmgren to utilize his ballhandling, passing and fluidity as a shot-creator more frequently. Only 20 of Gonzaga's 2,064 (0.97%) half-court possessions this season ended with Holmgren handling the ball in a pick-and-roll or isolation play, per Synergy Sports tracking, a number he might surpass in his very first game in the NBA. To do so, he will need to both gain strength and ramp up his assertiveness, as he often looked content to defer to Gonzaga's older stars and blend into the background, something whichever NBA team that drafts him will certainly work to change and force him out of his comfort zone. On the other end of the floor, Holmgren will likely emerge as an All-Defensive Team contender relatively early in his career, as his length, timing, mobility and toughness both as a rim protector and in covering ground on the perimeter should translate seamlessly to the modern NBA. He was already the most impactful defensive player in the college game as a freshman. Holmgren's early tournament departure, combined with Banchero's sensational performances, likely opened the door even wider to the conversation of who should be the No. 1 pick in the draft. Ultimately, that will likely come down to which team lands that pick on May 17, the night of the NBA draft lottery, and what it values (and already has in place) as an organization. We'll likely never see a prospect quite like Holmgren again at the college level, and whether we saw the full extent of his talent is something we'll fully know in the coming years. -- Jonathan Givony March 21, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Where they rank following first weekend of NCAA tournament) -- Gonzaga escaped with a win against freshman center Jalen Duren and a powerful Memphis squad that put quite a scare into the NCAA tournament's No. 1 overall seed, with Holmgren having a somewhat underwhelming performance by his lofty standards. It started with real fireworks between the projected top-10 picks, with Holmgren stifling Duren repeatedly inside the post, showing impressive toughness and fight despite giving up more than 50 pounds, along with his extraordinary length and timing challenging him at the rim. Foul trouble prevented the two from seeing as much head-to-head action as scouts may have liked, with both players in foul trouble, but Holmgren still clearly got the best of the matchup. Holmgren was somewhat passive offensively by his recent standards, not looking to push the ball off the defensive glass or exploit mismatches in short-roll situations as aggressively as in previous showings. His outside shot wasn't falling either, as he's hit a bit of a cold streak, converting just 1 of his last 14 attempts from 3, but is still at 39% from 3 on the season. He also missed two of his three free throws, including the front end of a key 1-and-1, which is uncharacteristic. While nerves may have been a factor, he also seemed to be deferring to the experience of upperclassmen stars Drew Timme and Andrew Nembhard, who were both having huge games and carrying the team in different stretches.  Despite his relatively muted impact offensively, Holmgren was a huge factor defensively as usual, blocking four shots, challenging countless others and finishing +18 in a game Gonzaga won by four. Naysayers will point to the struggles he had dealing with physicality, as he got pushed around on the glass at times and dunked on emphatically by Duren while attempting to draw a charge. Holmgren moves onto the Sweet 16, where he'll face another formidable opponent in Arkansas, with the No. 1 defense in the SEC, another great opportunity to solidify his standing at the top of the draft against top-level competition. -- Jonathan Givony March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- We've truly never seen an NBA prospect quite like Holmgren: A shot-blocking, lob-catching, 3-point shooting, ballhandling 7-foot-1 ""big man"" with the fluidity of a guard and a relentlessness that doesn't match his slender, 195-pound frame. With a body type that earns him comparisons ranging from Kevin Durant to Brandon Ingram to Kristaps Porzingis to Bol Bol, Holmgren has let his game do the talking, as he is in the midst of a record-breaking freshman season for Gonzaga. He is the only prospect in NCAA history to average at least 14 points, nine rebounds and three blocks while shooting over 70% from 2 and 40% from 3, and he's doing so on the No. 1 team.  Despite facing Duke, UCLA, Alabama and Texas Tech in nonconference play, a heavy dose of Holmgren's true highlights came against West Coast Conference opponents, as he took more of a back seat offensively against the Blue Devils, Crimson Tide and others. Holmgren averaged 12.6 points per game on 66.4% true shooting in 18 games against teams over .500 as opposed to 16.9 points on 78.1% true shooting in fewer minutes across 11 bouts versus teams with a losing record. Will Holmgren defer to veterans Drew Timme and Andrew Nembhard with the season on the line or will we see the pull-up 3s and coast-to-coast slams that became a regularity in WCC play? How will Holmgren's frame fare against more physical tournament opponents, particularly Memphis big man and projected top-10 pick Jalen Duren, as Duren, with his Dwight Howard-like physical profile, is the exact type of player that Holmgren's biggest naysayers worry he'll struggle against in the NBA. -- Mike Schmitz March 8, 2022: Why is Gonzaga's Chet Holmgren so polarizing with NBA scouts? LINK","Oklahoma City is in as good of a shape as any team can reasonably expect after losing 70% of their games the past two seasons. There's a strong core of young talent in place, headlined by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey, 14 future first-round picks over the next five drafts, a clean cap sheet, and a coaching staff that has drawn rave reviews from rostered players -- making the Thunder a more attractive destination currently than most would expect. Landing the No. 2 pick was important after the season they endured, giving the front office an opportunity to add another potential star and possibly signaling the end of their rebuilding process and a pivot towards respectability with the immense flexibility and assets the front office has stockpiled.  Who we consider the draft's best prospect fell right into the laps of the Thunder in Chet Holmgren. He was the most impactful two-way player in college basketball as a freshman. His timing, length, mobility and toughness made him an absolute force both as a rim-protector and covering ground on the perimeter. He's effective guarding pick-and-roll in a variety of different schemes with his ability to hedge, trap, drop or switch and contain smaller players, getting in a deep, agile stance, turning his hips to rotate from one side of the paint to another, and using his 7-6 wingspan and quick instincts to challenge jumpers and layups and usually be first off the ground for defensive rebounds.  Holmgren is similarly versatile offensively as well. Operating alongside two of the best college upperclassmen in Drew Timme and Andrew Nembhard, Holmgren played a complementary role for Gonzaga last season, mostly being used as a floor-spacer, rim-runner, cutter, offensive rebounder and pick-and-roll finisher. He was brutally efficient, hitting 39% of his 3-pointers and a scorching 74% of his 2s, finishing with 56 dunks and the second-highest true shooting percentage in this draft class. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jabari Smith Jr.",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Auburn","AUB",NA,NA,NA,"March 21, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Where they rank following first weekend of NCAA tournament) -- Smith built his candidacy as a potential No. 1 pick by making impossible shots look easy all season. Those shots stopped falling at the worst time possible in a frenetic, up-tempo, small-ball game that saw Auburn completely fall apart in a loss to Miami, shooting 30% from the field and trailing from the opening tip.  Smith had easily his worst offensive game of the season, shooting 1-for-8 from 3 and 2-for-8 from 2, looking discombobulated by Miami's unorthodox style, and never finding any type of rhythm, like the rest of his team. Variance, and the extremely high degree of difficulty of attempts he lives off with his sped-up style will lead to nights like this on occasion, but it was still shocking to see it play out. After 34 games, playing against an elite strength of schedule, NBA teams know exactly the type of prospect Smith is. Still, only two players over 6-6 have ever been drafted in the lottery after shooting under 45% from 2-point range (Cam Reddish and Ziaire Williams), and Smith's lack of explosiveness, extreme reliance on difficult jumpers and inability to create easy shots for himself or others inside the arc reared its head several times in this game, as it has all season. On the positive side, Smith didn't go down without a fight, grabbing a career-high 15 rebounds, posting three blocks and showing terrific effort all game long sliding his feet on the perimeter and covering ground all over the floor. He was obviously distraught in defeat, and can't be solely blamed for the loss, as his entire team (and coaching staff) had a very poor showing. Smith will still be a top-3 draft pick ultimately, but his chances of going No. 1 got a little bit smaller with this surprising upset, even if he'll surely still receive strong consideration depending on which team gets the pick. -- Jonathan Givony March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Smith has emerged as one of the most dynamic shooters in college, converting 43% of his 3-pointers despite standing 6-foot-10. Running off screens, pulling up in transition, making iso step-back jumpers and hitting impossible fadeaways out of the post -- seemingly no shot is too difficult for the 18-year-old thanks to his high release point and soft touch. Smith is also a highly versatile defender who plays with outstanding intensity, switching all over the floor with quick feet and impressive energy. He has been just as effective against elite-level competition as he was early in the season, as his confidence has grown and the degree of difficulty of attempts has increased with little drop-off. NBA scouts have questions about Smith's ability to create offense for himself and others and be efficient inside the arc. He lacks a degree of strength and explosiveness, converting just 44% from 2-point range. And he has averaged as many turnovers as assists, making it difficult for him to emerge as a late-game, go-to option, which has hampered Auburn at times with its inconsistent guard play. -- Jonathan Givony February 22, 2022: (Mock Draft and Top 100 update) -- Smith leapfrogs Duke's Paolo Banchero (more to come on him later this week) for the No. 2 spot in our Top 100 and, as we wrote in January, has an excellent chance to ultimately be the top pick in the draft if he continues on this trajectory throughout the SEC and NCAA tournaments. Givony and I got live looks at the 18-year-old within the past few weeks, and we were yet again blown away with his combination of defense and shooting versatility, continuing to torch opponents with pull-up 3s, step-backs, turnarounds and on-the-move jumpers thanks to his high release, footwork and feathery touch.  Over his last 5 games Smith is averaging 19 points in just 29.4 minutes while shooting a blistering 53% from 3 on 6 attempts per game while defending multiple positions and playing with the type of intensity you don't always see from elite prospects. On the flip side, his 2-point percentage continues to dip (44%), his ball handling and passing are still works in progress, and Smith has failed to reach double-digits scoring three times in his past 8 games. But the highs have been breathtaking, and Smith is about as close to a ""no fail"" type of prospect as you'll find thanks to his stellar combination of defense, shooting and intangibles. Chet Holmgren remains at No. 1 as he's having a record-breaking season in terms of efficiency (72.7 true shooting percentage) while showing some downright silly flashes on both ends of the floor in WCC play, yet you won't be hard-pressed to find high-ranking executives who view Smith as the clear top prospect in the draft. After spending time with Smith in Auburn, Alabama and breaking down film with him, he'll only strengthen his case once he gets in front of NBA teams in the interview process. Ask him if he's the best prospect in the draft, Smith calmly says: ""I feel like I am."" As for his ceiling? ""I think the ceiling's very high,"" Smith said. ""I feel like my ability to guard 1 through 5 efficiently, being able to play so many different roles on a team. If you need me to stand in the corner, just play defense and shoot, I'll do that. If you need me to make a play, I'll do that. I don't really care about stats. I just care about winning ... With my potential and my work ethic, I just feel like my ceiling has no choice but to be high.""  - Mike Schmitz January 21, 2022: Why Auburn's Jabari Smith might be the No. 1 pick in the 2022 NBA draft, and who might select him (LINK)","Houston is in the thick of rebuilding in the wake of the James Harden and Daryl Morey eras, finishing with the league's worst record for two consecutive seasons. With the bulk of the assets from the Harden trade coming in the form of future picks and pick-swaps from Brooklyn over the next five years, how much value the Rockets ultimately see from the deal will depend heavily on how the Nets look in the coming years. The Rockets will continue to look to add star-power in the draft, after selecting the electrifying but still youthful Jalen Green in 2021, who showed significant promise as a rookie. Falling two spots on lottery night was discouraging, but with little consensus among the NBA regarding who the draft's best long-term prospect is, they can still hope to emerge with a star, who also happens to play a position of need in the frontcourt.  The Rockets are early in their rebuilding process and had an easy choice when presented with the surprising slide of Jabari Smith. Drafting arguably the most dynamic shooter in the class in Auburn's Smith -- who made 42% of his 3-pointers and stands 6-10 -- makes sense. No draft pick that size has ever converted the volume of 3-pointers he made with that type of accuracy in college basketball history. Running off screens, pulling up in transition, making iso step-backs, and hitting impossible fadeaways out of the post, no shot appears to be too difficult for Smith thanks to his high release point and soft touch, which also makes him near-automatic on corner 3s. The intensity level, footwork, balance and versatility Smith brings defensively will be attractive as well, along with the fact that he just turned 19 years old and checks every box the Rockets look for from a character and competitiveness standpoint. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Keegan Murray",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Iowa","IOWA",NA,NA,NA," March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Fresh off a record-breaking Big Ten tournament, Murray enters the Big Dance with as much momentum as any NBA prospect. The 21-year-old Murray, who is shooting 63% from 2 and 40% from 3, has turned himself into arguably the best player in college basketball and the most complete prospect in the draft as a 6-foot-9 forward with length and a modern skill set. He is a lights-out shooter with NBA range who doesn't need much time to get his shot off, even sprinting around screens like a wing. He can push the ball himself in transition or run the floor like a center. He is an ambidextrous, straight-line driver who also can play some pick-and-roll and punish smaller defenders with turnarounds over either shoulder. He's an active offensive rebounder and a defensive playmaker.  Murray leads the nation in win shares, ranks fourth in scoring and has been a driving force in Iowa's March run, making timely shots with the type of unwavering confidence and focus we've seen from stars such as Kawhi Leonard and Tim Duncan. Although still improving as a passer, Murray has added something new to his offensive repertoire seemingly every game and has the next-play mentality that generally shines in the postseason. NBA scouts will have a close eye on whether Murray can take over games like he showed in the Big Ten tournament. If he can, that would go a long way in convincing execs the Iowa star isn't just a ""high-floor NBA starter"" but rather that his production is more than a product of Iowa's system and he belongs in the same conversation as Holmgren and Smith as a member of the draft's elite. -- Mike Schmitz January 5, 2022: (Top 100) -- Murray's ascension from a no-name high school recruit with just one Division I offer (from Western Illinois) to an All-American might be the best story of any prospect in this draft class.  A bit player as a freshman, Murray is now college basketball's leading scorer, shooting 69% from inside the arc while filling up the rest of the box score impressively with rebounds, blocks and steals in just 29 minutes per game. Murray has been performing like a national player of the year candidate, and perfectly fits what the NBA is looking for with his ability to defend all over the floor, score without needing plays called for him and play a highly efficient, mistake-free style. Yet, there's a degree of skepticism from scouts due to Iowa's extremely weak nonconference schedule to this point, which ranks No. 345 in the country. Murray also sat out a game against No. 3 Purdue because of an ankle sprain, and had his worst game of the season in a blowout loss to in-state rivals Iowa State, one of the few real tests his team has faced thus far. All that's about to change as Big Ten play ramps up in the coming weeks, which should provide ample opportunity for Murray to show sustained improvement. Shooting the ball more consistently from beyond the arc would be a welcome start -- Murray has converted just 33% of his career 3-pointers at Iowa -- while demonstrating some ability to convert off movement, picking and popping, coming off screens and making pull-up jumpers in small doses. His solid mechanics, excellent free throw percentage (82%) and soft touch around the basket should help his cause. While not a brilliant ball handler, Murray is a versatile weapon on offense, from pushing the ball off the defensive glass to finding the open man and finishing explosively around the basket. He's also turning the ball over on a microscopic 5.6% of his possessions, a testament to his feel for the game and willingness to stay within himself. Of high interest for NBA evaluators is the way Murray alternates between anchoring the Hawkeyes' defense from the 5-spot atop their full-court press, to showing terrific instincts in half-court defensive situations by rotating from the weak side for blocks, getting in passing lanes and locking up on switches. At 6-foot-8, he looks legitimately big enough to see minutes as a small-ball center in the NBA. Once criticized for lacking a degree of grit earlier in his career, Murray's ability to sustain the intensity level and aggressiveness he has demonstrated this season while leading Iowa to the NCAA tournament would go a long way in solidifying him as a top-10 pick. -- Jonathan Givony","In the midst of a NBA-record 16-year playoff drought, the Kings hired their 12th coach this summer since last making a playoff appearance in Mike Brown, hoping to reverse the fortunes of a downtrodden franchise. After swapping the promising Tyrese Haliburton for Domantas Sabonis at the trade deadline, it's not entirely clear how close the team is to returning to respectability, but moving up on the night of the lottery three spots to the No. 4 pick surely helps matters, even though most talent evaluators feel there is cut-off in this year's draft after the third pick. With ownership gunning for a playoff run, but the front office only under contract for one more year, NBA executives have many question marks about the direction the franchise will look to head in. Trade rumors swirled around this pick for weeks prior to draft night.  Murray was the most productive player in college basketball, becoming the first player since Glen Rice in 1989 to average over 23 points per game, shooting over 60% from 2 and 39% from 3. He also fits a position and role every NBA team is looking for as a big wing who can operate as an ultra-versatile power forward or slide up as a small-ball center, which he did with great success at Iowa. Jumbo lineups with Murray at small forward are also a distinct possibility in the NBA, as he shows the ability to cover ground effectively in space, was often utilized at the top of Iowa's press and shows strong instincts as a shot-blocker as well.  -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jaden Ivey",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Purdue","PUR",NA,NA,NA,"March 28, 2022: (Final Four week mock draft) -- Ivey's collegiate career came to a screeching halt at the hands of a stout Saint Peter's defense that slowed the dynamic guard in transition, packed the paint and ultimately limited the potential top-five pick to just his third single-digit scoring output of the season: 9 points on 12 shots, with a season-high six turnovers.  The Peacocks did a tremendous job of sprinting back in transition and building a wall to deter Ivey's best attribute: his open-court speed. In the half court, Ivey constantly saw multiple bodies, forcing him into kickouts, tough jump passes, contested 3s and off-balance midrange pull-ups. On one hand, Ivey will have way more space to operate at the NBA level, allowing him to unleash his incredible burst while tapping into more of the playmaking potential we saw glimpses of this season. He'll be playing with a far more agile big man than Purdue's Zach Edey. On the other hand, the Boilermakers' loss did further accentuate Ivey's shortcomings as a decision-maker when he isn't able to simply rely on knifing through opposing defenses and get wherever he wants to on the floor. Too often walking around when the ball isn't in his hands, Ivey has a lot of bad habits to address as he transitions to playing alongside more ball-dominant perimeter players at the next level. On top of that, his defensive intensity still needs work, particularly off the ball. He has proved more than capable of containing the ball and using his quick feet and long arms to be disruptive for stretches, but that type of urgency isn't as frequent as you'd hope. Ivey's NCAA tournament as a whole wasn't a disappointment by any stretch. He completed several plays that no other prospect in this class could execute in terms of sheer burst, quickness and leaping ability. He made 38% of his 3s, including a clutch trey against Texas to put the game on ice. He still finished the season averaging 17.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.1 assists on one of the best teams in the Big Ten while all but solidifying himself as a top-five pick. But the fact that he was unable to lift the Boilermakers past Saint Peter's, finished the tournament with twice as many turnovers as assists and at times looked a little too casual in his approach suggests he still has work to do before he can be considered a true franchise lead guard. Before the NCAA tournament, I broke down how Ivey was one of the few players who could potentially crack the top three -- and even the top two -- if he were to lead Purdue to a national title, growing into an on-court leader and primary shot-creator in the process. While he is still an incredibly promising guard prospect perfectly built for the NBA game, Ivey was unable to leapfrog the likes of Chet Holmgren, Jabari Smith and Paolo Banchero with his performance in March, leaving it up to the pre-draft process to convince teams he belongs amongst the draft's elite. -- Mike Schmitz  March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Ivey is the most electric guard in college, possessing the type of extra gear-changing speeds in the open floor that few NBA players possess. He also has gradually emerged as a more consistent force in Purdue's half-court offense, doing a better job of harnessing his explosiveness, picking his spots and making others better, even if his decision-making still leaves something to be desired at times. Ivey also has improved his perimeter shooting, considered the weaker part of his game earlier in his career, hitting 36% of his 3-pointers this season.  He can be a playmaker defensively when engaged, thanks to his huge wingspan and impressive lateral quickness, but he loses his focus frequently and has too many bad moments falling asleep off the ball. NBA teams will want to see how Ivey steps up the plate and delivers for Purdue in high-leverage moments in what will be the most important games he has played in his college career, especially with the ball in his hands, provided Purdue's coaches trust him enough to give him the keys. -- Jonathan Givony","Two years into the Troy Weaver era in Detroit, the team is still in an early stage of putting together the pieces of a roster that can compete for a playoff spot down the line. Landing Cade Cunningham with the No. 1 pick was a major coup last year, but he'll need help, putting a lot of pressure on making the right pick here after falling two spots on the night of the NBA draft lottery to a much less favorable range. The team also has significant cap space to make a splash in free agency if it chooses after trading Jerami Grant to Portland, either by aggressively pursuing veterans or by acting as king-makers on the trade market.  There's a strong case to be made that Ivey's potential is only scratching the surface. He wasn't heavily recruited out of high school and didn't become a regular starter as a freshman at Purdue until conference play. He wasn't really on many NBA teams' radars before exploding for 26 points in an NCAA tournament game against North Texas in March 2021, followed by a breakout showing at the FIBA U19 World Cup last summer when he helped Team USA win a gold medal alongside Holmgren, Johnny Davis and others.  Although Ivey emerged as an All-American last season, in many ways he's still more prospect than player. Besides the incredible jets and powerful change of gears he shows in the open floor, Ivey has made increasingly notable strides as a shooter -- both off the dribble and with his feet set, even from well beyond the arc -- and passer, especially on the move. Playing with a more consistent level of aggressiveness on both ends of the floor will go a long way for Ivey to maximize his potential, as will gaining experience and learning the nuances of the pick-and-roll game, driving and finishing with his weaker left hand, and making better decisions with the ball.  The point guard position is the most difficult to learn in basketball, and it's important to remember that Ivey is young for a sophomore, the same age or younger than freshmen including Holmgren and TyTy Washington Jr. Ivey has the tools to be one of the best players in this draft, and the fact that he is the son of former NFL and WNBA players is something NBA teams are acutely aware of considering the number of second-generation pros who have vastly exceeded expectations. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Bennedict Mathurin",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arizona","ARIZ",NA,NA,NA,"March 28, 2022: (Final Four week mock draft) -- Mathurin's stellar sophomore season ended in underwhelming fashion, as the projected top-10 pick went just 4-for-14 from the field in Arizona's Sweet 16 loss to Houston, missing all six of his shots in the first half while struggling to find consistency on the defensive end against a red-hot Kyler Edwards and a hard-nosed Cougars team.  Mathurin was bound for regression after a superhuman performance against TCU in which he looked like a top-five pick, finishing with 30 points, 8 rebounds and 4 assists on just 19 shots, while drawing eight fouls in just over 40 minutes. He hammered home a highlight poster dunk, splashed on-the-move 3s, sent the game to overtime with an NBA-range pull-up 3 and even displayed considerable signs of growth as a passer. The last two games of Mathurin's season sum up the 19-year-old potential top-10 pick: He is a somewhat polarizing prospect to NBA executives given the highs that you only see from NBA All-Stars and the lows that leave you wanting more. On the bright side, Mathurin has a clear-cut role at the next level. He has turned his jump shot into a weapon, as he has proved comfortable sprinting off screens and handoffs into elevation 3s that few players in the draft can think to attempt. He drilled yet another pair of highly contested off-screen 3s against Houston that will undoubtedly translate to the NBA. (Mathurin shot 37% from 3 on six attempts per game this season.) Mathurin also knifed through Houston's defense with a pair of straight-line drives that showcased his combination of burst, power and body control. At 6-foot-6 and 210 pounds with a 6-foot-9 wingspan, he has proved vertically explosive off one foot or two feet and has the type of legs and balance teams look for in an off guard. (Jason Richardson comes to mind.) Mathurin also has shown progress as a passer, dropping the ball off to open bigs once he gets a piece of the paint, making one-handed kickouts while on the move to his right hand and throwing lobs out of the pick-and-roll. With all that said, Mathurin had his roller-coaster games during which his shot selection and defensive intensity left much to be desired for long stretches, before eventually flipping a switch and showing signs of life. His defensive motor and overall attention to detail on that end of the floor is his biggest question mark. He completely forgot about the scorching Edwards on several occasions during the Houston loss, including on a crucial possession with the Wildcats down six and mounting a comeback with around two minutes remaining. Mathurin also is regularly caught upright in his stance on the ball, allowing guards to reject screens with little resistance. He is an inconsistent defensive rebounder, as well. Mathurin is more than capable of being the best defender on the floor when he is engaged given his tremendous tools and quickness, yet we simply don't see him unleash it enough. Even so, Mathurin, who is the age of some freshmen, clearly made the right decision coming back to school for another year after testing the waters in 2021, when he might have been selected late in the first round. He expanded his offensive game, improved as a ball handler and passer, became a more consistent threat from 3, added a more reliable floater and played a huge role in Arizona's incredible season that saw the Wildcats rank in the top 10 in offensive efficiency and pace. Despite the rough showing in the loss to Houston, he showed real character in the overtime win over TCU, making winning plays down the stretch that we wouldn't have seen a season ago while putting Arizona on his back late. Mathurin has no shortage of fans in NBA circles, and given his combination of shot-making ability, three-level scoring, league-ready tools and confidence, he has an excellent chance to hear his name called anywhere in the range of pick Nos. 6 to 12, especially for a team in need of youthful legs and scoring punch on the perimeter. The question for NBA decision-makers long term is whether Mathurin projects as a streaky scorer who doesn't always bring it defensively or a true two-way guard who can score the ball at every level, go for 20 points on any given night and add value in the margins as a defender, rebounder and playmaker. -- Mike Schmitz March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- The Pac-12 player of the year, Mathurin made a big jump as a sophomore while leading Arizona in scoring. He fits an obvious mold as a strong-framed, 6-foot-6 wing who can space the floor from well beyond the NBA line, shoot running off screens or pulling up off the dribble, and finish explosively in the open floor. He also has made strides as a ball handler and passer, while still only being 19 years old. Mathurin's decision-making in high-leverage moments also will be closely scrutinized. He is at his best when keeping things simple, and he can be prone to huge swings of intensity and productivity on both ends of the floor, depending on the night and how well things are going early in games. The defensive end is where scouts will want to see Mathurin show better focus, especially off the ball, where he can at times be Arizona's weakest link. -- Jonathan Givony","After years of treading water, last winning a playoff series in 2014, Indiana landed its highest draft pick since 1988, marking a rare opportunity to add a high-level talent to the roster since selecting Paul George at No. 10 in 2010. The bones of the roster have quite a bit of promise, especially since flipping Domantas Sabonis to Sacramento for a real cornerstone in Tyrese Haliburton. The team also has several strong pieces in place in Malcolm Brogdon, Myles Turner, Buddy Hield and Chris Duarte, all of whom would be attractive to playoff contenders if they elected to embark on a full-fledged rebuilding campaign, which looks unlikely. This pick will tell us quite a bit about the direction of the team, be it a quick return to competing for the play-in game or a more patient tear-down that will take several years to complete but could put the Pacers in a better position to compete for winning a playoff series.  The Pac-12 Player of the Year and an All-American, Mathurin fits a mold every NBA team is looking for as a strong-framed, long-armed, explosive 6-6 wing who can space the floor from well beyond the 3-point line, make an exceptionally high degree of difficulty shots running off screens and handoffs or pulling up off the dribble, and finish powerfully in the open floor. He also has made strides as a ball handler and passer, while still only being 19 years old, giving him a nice blend of current productivity and upside that ultimately helped fuel his rise.  Showing a large degree of confidence when he's rolling, he is at his best when keeping things simple as he can be prone to huge swings of intensity and productivity on both ends of the floor depending on the night. The defensive end is where scouts will want to see Mathurin grow as his NBA career progresses, especially with his focus off the ball, as he has all the tools to be outstanding with his quickness and length, but was inconsistent at times for Arizona. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Shaedon Sharpe",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kentucky","UK"," -- Impressive physical profile for a perimeter prospect standing around 6-6 with super long arms, big hands and a proportionate frame. Even more impressive than the sheer measurements is the way Sharpe moves. His balance and body control are elite as he can play low to the ground with ease before exploding off the floor. He has an excellent base and some of the best physical literacy you'll see from a prospect. Because of all that, he's more than capable of defending his position and making plays off the ball when engage thanks to his solid all-around instincts, anticipation and hand-eye coordination.  -- Sharpe's best NBA-ready skill is his shooting. He sports compact mechanics that starts with excellent shot preparation. The ball comes out of his hands cleanly and he doesn't need to be perfectly on balance or set to knock down shots, which is a big part of what gives him so much upside as a scorer. He doesn't always need a ball dip to generate rhythm off the catch. He showed the ability to make shots off the dribble as well, even if he looks better on pull-up 3s than mid-range at this stage.  -- Maybe the most encouraging takeaway from this evaluation was the growth Sharpe showed as a passer. He made several impressive reads during live action, including a transition bounce pass through traffic right to the rim-runner that led to an open finish. He made heady kickouts after getting a piece of the paint and even showed the ability to make some left handed deliveries. He's really comfortable as a ball handler, which is pretty rare for a player with his athletic profile. The game comes incredibly easy for Sharpe, and if he can continue tapping into his playmaking potential, his offensive ceiling is high. Improvement Areas:  -- It's clear Sharpe is still very much learning the ins and outs of playing within a system on both ends of the floor. He's still picking up sets, learning spacing, and understanding where to be off the ball defensively, which will likely be his biggest hurdle early on in his NBA career. As we've outlined in previous pieces, Sharpe simply doesn't have all that much high-level experience outside of AAU, high school basketball, and a six-game FIBA stint with the Canadian Youth national team at the 2019 U16 Americas, where he averaged an impressive 13 points and 2.3 assists in just 21.4 minutes.  -- Sharpe is still learning how to best utilize his talents, sometimes not always getting all the way to the rim when he could, especially when he's on his left hand, as he'll settle for floaters or pull ups rather than initiating contact. He would benefit from adding more advanced finishes when he does get all the way to the cup.  -- For as easily as he shoots the ball, Sharpe can be a little bit streakier than you'd hope given his natural touch and mechanics. According to our database he's a career 34.6% from 3 on 107 attempts.  -- Scouts will continue to dig more on Sharpe's competitive ticker and what he's like as a person, as he's not going to show you much of his emotion on the floor. He's relatively stoic by nature, and scouts will want to know whether that's in a quiet competitor, Kawhi Leonard type of way or more in line with a player like Cam Reddish, who also didn't show much personality on the floor yet didn't always have a consistent impact either. Outlook: This latest viewing was a reminder of just how physically talented and skilled Sharpe truly is, and there's a real argument to be made that he's the best perimeter prospect in this 2022 class, should he opt to enter and stay in the draft. Depending on what you think of prospects like Jabari Smith, Chet Holmgren, Paolo Banchero and Jaden Ivey, you could make a case that he has as much long-term upside as anyone, especially with NBA teams clamoring for perimeter players who can create offense for themselves and others at all 3 levels. While I mentioned players like Anthony Edwards and Jalen Green in our Sharpe deep dive, Paul George is a name that came to mind when watching Sharpe practice. While George is clearly much taller (6-9 to Sharpe's 6-6) and more wing than guard, Sharpe is that smooth and skilled of a scorer with the potential to develop into a reliable playmaker and defender like George has. They also have a similar on-court demeanor. With all that in mind, Sharpe is truly one of the most fascinating prospects in this draft because of his immense talent yet the act that we've never truly seen him in a competitive setting with several do-or-die possessions. Even so, I wouldn't be surprised to see Sharpe ultimately go in the top-5 of the 2022 NBA draft should he opt to stay in as it'll be incredibly difficult for teams who have seen him in person to pass on his combination of physical tools and talent on the perimeter.  -- Mike Schmitz February 15, 2022: Why Kentucky's Shaedon Sharpe is a difficult case for NBA scouts, whom he compares to, and more 2022 NBA draft mystery guys (LINK)  -- Jonathan Givony and Mike Schmitz ",NA,NA,"May 24, 2022: (Winners and losers of the 2022 NBA draft combine) -- Sharpe's pro day drew a huge audience of decision-makers from virtually every team to watch a player very few NBA executives had seen live. Sharpe started the workout with a bang, demonstrating his impressive vertical explosiveness and near 7-foot wingspan with a series of highlight-reel-caliber finishes, before proceeding to knock down a variety of difficult pull-up jumpers and step-backs from all over the floor. The feedback from the workout was varied. Several teams in the top 10 said they were blown away by Sharpe's overall talent level, while others said they were hoping to see other parts of his game, namely his first step and spot-up shooting ability, as they still don't know enough about him to make an accurate evaluation for how his career might look. Teams in Sharpe's range will get a closer look at him in the coming weeks in private workouts, which should provide more clarity on exactly how ready he is to help a NBA team and where he can expect to hear his name called on draft night. -- Jonathan Givony February 28, 2022: Along with several NBA scouts and executives, I was able to watch projected top-10 pick Shaedon Sharpe practice recently, which was my first live evaluation of the 6-6 Canadian wing since Peach Jam in July. Here's my quick scout on the highly touted 18-year-old: ","Portland was the most active team in the NBA at last February's trade deadline, signaling a shift to a different era that coincides with a new front office. The future of six-time All-NBA player Damian Lillard is the biggest question hovering over the franchise, especially the decision for whether to offer an extension that would make him one of the league's highest paid players into his mid-30s. Lillard's loyalty to the franchise and the leadership he brings off the court can't be discounted, and its possible a happy medium can be found with an eventual trade to a contender that can set up the team for a true rebuild around Anfernee Simons and whoever the team elects to select with this important draft pick. The decision for whether to resign unrestricted free agent Jusuf Nurkic, believed to be a formality by rival teams, will also tell us something about the direction the team is headed.  Sharpe's excellent size, frame, explosiveness, dynamic shot-making and overall scoring instincts make him one of the most tantalizing prospects in this draft class. He possesses everything NBA teams look for at his position, with considerable star power to grow into long-term. There's a reason he was considered the consensus No. 1 player in his high school class before electing to reclassify and enroll early at Kentucky.   Sharpe's terrific footwork and ability to make difficult pull-up, stepback and side-step 3s with deep range and compact mechanics operating one-on-one gives him considerable upside when paired with the length and explosiveness he shows as a finisher around the basket. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Dyson Daniels",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"G League Ignite","G League Ignite",NA,NA,NA,"May 24, 2022: (Winners and losers of the 2022 NBA draft combine) -- Daniels continued his rapid ascent with an impressive showing at the Octagon Pro Day, where he displayed impressive shot-making prowess. Decision-makers from virtually every team in the NBA lottery were on hand to watch what appeared to be, in my view, the most eye-opening workout of the week in Chicago. NBA teams were buzzing afterward about Daniels' talent, throwing out comparisons to the likes of Tyrese Haliburton and Khris Middleton. Daniels, an alumnus of the NBA Global Academy and G League Ignite program, has grown considerably in the past few years, adding 3 inches and 30 pounds of bulk. Even so, he appears nowhere close to reaching his physical potential with an outstanding frame and near 7-foot wingspan. The knowledge that Daniels has guard skills, with measurements that should allow him to moonlight at power forward as his frame fills out over time, is intriguing in today's NBA. The way teams rave about Daniels' interviews at the combine and the background intel they have received is clearly working in his favor. There's a real comfort level with what seems to be an extremely high floor for Daniels as a prospect, while the thought process regarding his ultimate ceiling appears to be evolving daily. -- Jonathan Givony February 22, 2022: (Mock Draft and Top 100 update) -- With the G League Ignite season winding down, the 18-year-old Australian-American guard has cemented himself as the top NBA prospect on the prospect-laden team, and a likely lottery pick come June. High-level NBA decision makers were able to get (likely) one final look at Daniels and the rest of the Ignite prospects in Cleveland over All-Star break in the Rising Stars game, during a practice at the Cavaliers practice facility, and against the Cleveland Charge on Sunday. We attended both the Rising Stars Game and a portion of the Ignite practice, where a handful of NBA general managers and presidents sat courtside to evaluate Daniels and company. While the Rising Stars Game clearly has an All-Star feel to it, what stood out most was just how Daniels more than fits in physically with some of the NBA's top young talent, not looking too far off in terms of functional size from a 6-8 rookie like Cade Cunningham.  You'd regularly hear scouts and execs comment, ""he's huge!"" in regards to Daniels, who becomes even more interesting if he can function as a playmaking wing in addition to a secondary ball-handler. Daniels made the most of his weekend in the Midwest by following up the Rising Stars game with an 18-point, 13-rebound, 6-assist performance in a narrow loss to the Charge, scoring out of the post, knocking down spot 3s, pull-ups, attacking the glass and making smart reads, as usual. The fact that Daniels is shooting just 26% from 3 and 59% from the free throw line according to our database, while still turning down rhythm looks too often will give some executives pause. He'll likely never be overly shifty with the ball, isn't the most outwardly confident prospect, and he's a bit too reliant on his patented spin move and two-foot floater in the lane at times. But if you view Daniels as more of a secondary ball-handler who can defend three or four positions given his size and defensive instincts, knock down open spot 3s and make reads off second-side pick-and-roll, it's easy to envision him eventually evolving into an NBA starter, potentially sooner than later given his physical tools and mature style of play. Having been able to watch him shoot extensively both in practice and warm-up settings, he has the mechanics and touch to develop into a reliable floor spacer in time so long as he can keep speeding up his release and remain confident after misses.  The 18-year-old has filled up the stat sheet for the Ignite all season, earning rave reviews from the staff and teammates. Given his positional size, feel for the game, professional approach, and two-way impact, Daniels has as high of a floor as any perimeter player in this class and is deserving of interest throughout the back-half of the top-10 all the way through the late lottery, which he has a chance to solidify during the Ignite's final four games of the season.  - Mike Schmitz","New Orleans may very well be in the most enviable short-term position of any team drafting in the lottery, not a surprise considering they received this pick from the Los Angeles Lakers as part of the Anthony Davis trade, which will still yield significant dividends over the next three years. In addition to draft capital, the team also has two young All-Stars in Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram, as well as excellent pieces to surround them with in CJ McCollum and Jonas Valanciunas. With 2020 lottery pick Kira Lewis returning after a knee injury, it's not quite clear where there will be minutes available for a rookie selected at this spot, which caused many teams around the league to inquire about the availability of this draft pick in the lead-up to draft night. The team elected to stand pat, adding another promising talent they'll look to develop and potentially flip later in a bid to become more serious championship contenders.  Daniels was perhaps the most improved player in this draft class from early in the season to March, helping him boost his stock firmly into the top 10. Daniels sprouted up to nearly 6-8 in shoes with a big wingspan and an outstanding frame that will continue to add bulk as his career moves on, giving him the type of multi-positional versatility every team covets in the backcourt.   Daniels' defense will get him on the court early in his NBA career and will likely become his calling card. He brings a rare combination of discipline, awareness and intensity on and off the ball that you rarely see from 19-year-olds, consistently fighting over screens, denying off the ball and mirroring smaller players with quick hip turns and excellent feet. Even though his frame is still evolving -- not a surprise considering he played most of the G League season as an 18-year-old, he regularly put the clamps on players much older and more physical than him, while often getting in passing lanes for steals or rotating from the weak side for blocks.  Daniels' evolution offensively will end up determining how high he should have been drafted when it's all said and done. He struggled to make shots early in the season as he transitioned to the longer NBA 3-point line, but made significant strides as the year moved on, converting 42% of his 3-pointers over the last two months of the G League season. The touch he shows on his jumper, as well as on his buttery floater -- his go-to move right now -- bodes well for his prospects in this department, as does the way coaches and teammates rave about the work ethic and focus he shows off the court. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jeremy Sochan",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Baylor","BAY",NA,NA,NA," March 21, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Where they rank after first weekend of the NCAA tournament) -- Although Baylor's valiant 25-point comeback fell short against North Carolina in overtime, Sochan showed quite a bit of character during the Bears' short-lived NCAA tournament run, averaging 15 points, nine rebounds and three assists in 30 minutes while shooting 50% from 2 and 3-of-9 from 3. Sochan's energy, competitiveness, defensive versatility and toughness shined through in the second half against UNC and it's become increasingly clear that he's not only the best NBA prospect on his team, but a potential lottery pick if he can convince teams of his shooting throughout the pre-draft process. He fought until the bitter end against the Tar Heels, flying around at the top of the Baylor press, switching onto guards, battling inside, crashing the offensive glass, diving on the floor for loose balls and trying to change shots around the rim.  Sochan naysayers will question his elite NBA skill, which is fair. He has nice size at around 6-9 and 230 pounds with solid agility, yet he's not long (7-0 wingspan), isn't overly quick or vertically explosive and he's not much of a threat to score in the half court, which we saw against the Tar Heels. UNC bigs Armando Bacot and Brady Manek regularly closed out short and dared him to beat them from 3, which limited Sochan's downhill attacks and led to some underwhelming possessions that highlighted his lack of a reliable jumper and somewhat limited burst off the bounce (4-for-14 from the field). Analytics models will flag his 58.9% free throw clip and sub-30% 3-point shooting. Sochan's 14.3 points per 40 minutes also rank in the bottom 15 among ESPN's top-100. Yet, Sochan attempting 4.3 threes per 40 minutes this season is encouraging as far as his confidence is concerned, and watching him shoot in person several times, he has touch and solid mechanics, even showing the ability to knock down pull-ups and mid-post turnarounds on occasion. If he can turn himself into a league-average shooter, then he'll be able to unleash the ballhandling and passing we saw this season and so regularly with the Polish junior national team. Sochan has a chance to be an instant NBA contributor defensively as he's comfortable switching out onto guards, tracking big wings and has at least shown the willingness to slide up to the small-ball 5. He doesn't quite have the sheer reach and bounce to be a full-time protector at the 5, but the instincts are there (2.0 steals and 1.1 blocks per 40 minutes), and he's a solid positional rebounder who gravitates toward the ball and isn't afraid to mix it up in traffic. Being able to shift up to the 5 also makes him a far tougher cover offensively. At 18 years old with the type of versatility NBA teams covet, I'd fully expect Sochan to be a potential riser in the pre-draft process as teams get to know him, dive into his FIBA tape and unearth his shooting potential. Even if he doesn't evolve into a reliable half-court scorer, Sochan could thrive in a Boris Diaw-like role as a playmaking forward who makes his teammates better, adds value with his defensive versatility and does a lot of the little things that impact winning. -- Mike Schmitz March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Sochan is the prototypical ""initiator"" modern big who can defend 4s and 5s while bringing the ball up the floor in transition and creating for himself and others in the half court, looking like Baylor's version of Boris Diaw when he's at his best. Standing 6-foot-10 in shoes and weighing 230 pounds, Sochan has the size to slide up to the center spot for coach Scott Drew, showing the ability to battle more traditional bigs in the post and on the glass, which gives Sochan more room to tap into his handle and vision offensively when at the 5. Sochan gives Baylor a different dynamic as a small-ball 5, and a few strong NCAA tournament performances could help solidify his status as a potential lottery pick. Sochan's upside and draft stock will ultimately be decided by the type of shooter NBA teams think he can become, as he has converted just 29.2% of his 3s and 57.5% of his free throws. More mobile than overly quick or explosive, he'll have to rely more on skill than vertical pop in the NBA, making it that much more important that he is at least a threat from 3 to open up the rest of his game. -- Mike Schmitz January 21, 2022: (2023 Mock Draft) -- 6-10 Baylor forward Jeremy Sochan is another name to watch, as he was gaining considerable momentum as a 2022 prospect with his play in December -- 10.2 points, 6.4 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 54% from 3 off the bench -- before an ankle injury. Sochan has the size and feel for the game to evolve into one of the more productive sophomores in the country next season, similar to what we saw from Murray, albeit with a different style of play. Sochan should be able to boost his draft stock with a strong summer at the European Championships with the Polish Senior National Team, parlaying that into a breakout sophomore season alongside projected top-10 pick George, where he'd have plenty of chances to show more of the passing that made him unique at the FIBA youth level.  -- Mike Schmitz","Once the benchmark by which NBA teams measured themselves by, San Antonio has missed the playoffs for three consecutive seasons and are in a clear transition phase with legendary 73-year-old Gregg Popovich, the winningest coach in NBA history, likely to retire in the coming years. With the highest draft pick they've owned since selecting Tim Duncan No. 1 in 1997, the Spurs are in desperate need of star power with several interesting young pieces in place, but no clear cornerstone the franchise can definitively build around.  The Spurs surprised some last year by opting to pick the youngest player in the 2021 draft, Joshua Primo, higher than most projected, and this year's selection will tell us even more about the direction the team opts to head in after treading water to an extent the past several years. Declining Lonny Walker's 13-plus million qualifying offer could give the Spurs the cap space to become a real player in free agency, but the lack of great options on the market may hamper their enthusiasm for taking this route.  Sochan is a prototype for what many NBA teams look for currently in a modern big, with his ability to defend all over the floor, the strong feel for the game he shows as a passer, and an insatiable intensity level that gives him a high floor as a prospect when paired with the toughness and competitiveness he shows. For Sochan to reach his full potential, becoming a more consistent shooter and overall scorer will be important, but the fact that he just turned 19, is widely praised for his off-court intangibles, and is clearly on an upward trajectory development-wise, helps. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Johnny Davis",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wisconsin","WIS",NA,NA,NA," March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- The most improved player in college, Davis went from role player to superstar in the span of an offseason after winning a gold medal with USA Basketball. Davis' rebounding, defensive versatility and all-around grit stand out in addition to the strides he has made offensively. He is a streaky shooter who gets a lot of his offense in the post, on midrange pull-ups, in transition and while using his aggressiveness, physicality and smarts attacking out of the pick-and-roll. He has taken some lumps in the Big Ten, struggling at times to create efficient offense and making some scouts ponder just how heavy of an offensive role he can shoulder at the NBA level, something that will surely be scrutinized in the NCAA tournament. Few will question Davis' toughness or willingness to play a winning style of basketball, but the extent of his upside is still a topic of conversation, something he can push back against with a strong finish to his season. -- Jonathan Givony January 5, 2022: (Top 100) -- Davis had the single-most impressive performance of the season thus far -- a 37-point, 14-rebound explosion -- in a 74-69 road win over No. 3 Purdue.  The 19-year-old wasn't particularly well regarded coming out of high school, and showed few signs of turning into one of the best players in college basketball as a freshman, averaging 7 points per game coming off the bench. After helping USA basketball win a gold medal at the FIBA U19 World Cup this past summer, he has progressed into a likely All-American candidate. Davis displays an ideal combination of defensive toughness, transition scoring and playmaking ability for himself and others. He is Wisconsin's de facto point guard and generally makes solid decisions in creating open looks for teammates while putting nonstop pressure on the defense. Davis can operate out of the post or attack out of pick-and-roll, with the ability to connect from long range, hit midrange pull-ups and finish with either hand around the basket. While his scoring efficiency (48% from 2, 31% from 3) isn't ideal and he is inconsistent in generating assists compared to other combo guard prospects, he plays a winning style of basketball. Being forced to play an outsized role with little help around him will benefit his long-term development. The fact that he expends as much energy on the defensive end, especially in crashing the glass, is notable. Playing in the brutal Big Ten will test Davis, while also providing an ideal platform for scouts to evaluate him against a slew of projected draft picks. The fact that he doesn't turn 20 until the end of the college season will help his cause, as he will be one of the youngest sophomores projected to be drafted this summer. -- Jonathan Givony","Fueled by shrwedly trading Russell Westbrook to the LA Lakers for younger, more aptly-compensated players, Washington roared out of the gates in what proved to be an unsustainable start to last season, eventually falling apart after a season-ending injury to Bradley Beal. Extending Beal, believed by most NBA teams to be a formality, will be the first order of business, but improving at point guard and finding consistency defensively will be just as important as well. The Wizards will hope to see progress from their last three first-round draft picks -- Rui Hachimura, Deni Avdija and Corey Kispert -- while landing what they hope to be a long-term keeper with this current pick. The team had been active in trade conversations, according to several reports leading up to draft night, but elected to stand pat.

"ESPN","Ousmane Dieng",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NZ Breakers","NZ Breakers",NA,NA,NA,"April 6, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Where they rank following the Final Four) -- After watching a New Zealand Breakers practice, shootaround and NBL game in Cairns, Australia, Dieng reminded me exactly why he was once considered a top-10 prospect in this class and should earn late lottery consideration once NBA execs get eyes on the 18-year-old. Seeing him in live game action for the first time since the 2019 U16 European Championships, Dieng is now 6-10 in shoes with a 7-0 wingspan, thin yet developing frame, and guard-like agility that helps him on both ends of the floor. He was the best player on the court during the practice I evaluated, handling the ball with extreme fluidity while firing several one-handed passes you rarely see from players his height.  With the NBL season winding down, Dieng has put his forgettable start to the season behind him and is now playing the best basketball of his young career. After failing to reach double digits scoring the first 11 games of the season -- with two goose eggs sprinkled in -- Dieng has now scored at least 11 points in seven of his last nine games, capped off by 38 combined points in his last 47 minutes in back-to-back games against Cairns. During that two-game stretch the fluid forward showcased everything from spot 3s to pull-up jumpers to feathery floaters to downhill attacks to heady pick-and-roll reads. Dieng's defensive activity has also seen a major uptick, as he's just now starting to understand positioning, rotations and when to take risks versus when to stay solid, finishing with a season-high three steals on Monday.  The Frenchman shined in the game I scouted versus Brisbane. He drilled a pair of isolation pull-up 3s, a clutch catch-and-shoot corner 3, made intelligent reads as a passer and moved his feet well defensively while coming up with a key stop against veteran Lamar Patterson. While he shows real promise as a ball handler, pick-and-roll creator, shooter and is incredibly smooth with everything he does, Dieng is still a ways away from being able to impact winning at the NBA level, at least with any type of consistency. Although greatly improved, his defensive toughness comes and goes. He's a poor rebounder who doesn't always box out or pursue the ball. He's a finesse over physicality finisher. And he thumbs the ball as a shooter, which plays a role in the fact that he's shooting 24% from 3 and 64% from the free throw line. His success does come with a bit of a caveat, as the Breakers sit in last place of the NBL standings. There simply aren't many 6-10 forwards with a pass-dribble-shoot skill set quite like Dieng, and the fact that he's hitting stride toward the end of the NCAA season with execs making their way abroad to gauge this international crop bodes well for his draft stock. It's hard to see a scenario where Dieng makes it out of the teens if the right amount of decision makers see what I saw. Whether it's as a Nicolas Batum type, Kyle Anderson or some leaner version of Boris Diaw, there's a clear pathway and role for Dieng in the NBA. Dieng has persevered through a brutal start to the season, all while playing zero true home games with the New Zealand borders still closed due to the pandemic. Expect to hear his name a lot more between now and draft night, as he's the type of tantalizing talent that tends to rise in the pre-draft process.  -- Mike Schmitz Feb. 14, 2022: (Top 100) -- While we first evaluated Dieng back in 2019 as a 16-year-old and have scouted him extensively since, most NBA decision-makers have yet to see the tantalizing 6-10 wing in person for a variety of different reasons. For one, Dieng, whose mother is French and father is Senegalese, didn't partake in the highly attended FIBA U19 World Championships over the summer due to injury. He then signed with the New Zealand Breakers of the Australian NBL, yet non-Aussie scouts haven't been able to enter Australia this season due to COVID-19 restrictions. With 12 games now under his belt, Dieng will soon be thrust under the NBA microscope as Australia is set to open its borders on February 21st. Just as Dieng was starting to hit stride and play his best basketball of the season, he suffered a microfracture in his wrist and will miss the next two weeks, slightly delaying his long-awaited debut to NBA scouts and further adding to the mystery. So, what type of player is Dieng and what makes him tough for teams to figure out in addition to the lack of NBA evaluation opportunities? The late bloomer has always been more prospect than player, intriguing scouts with his combination of size, fluidity, shooting potential and passing upside yet not always turning his talent into real production. That's been the case so far this season as Dieng is shooting just 34% from 2 and 21% from 3 with a negative assist-to- turnover ratio. Despite tools similar to forwards ranging from Darius Bazle to Isaac Bonga to Michael Porter Jr. to Kevin Knox, Dieng has taken four free throws in 218 minutes and is very finesse-reliant. But with the Breakers shifting focus more toward development than making a playoff run, we're starting to see Dieng's talent come to life as of late, highlighted by a 14-point outburst in a loss to Sydney in which he knocked down 4-of-8 triples. When he's confident and aggressive, Dieng looks the part of a lottery pick as a modern forward who can space the floor off the catch or the bounce, handle the ball, make one-handed passes going right in pick-and-roll, toss in floaters and theoretically defend multiple positions in the Nicolas Batum mold. Yet the 18-year-old has had his struggles adjusting to the physicality of the NBL on both ends and is still learning the nuances of team defense. How far away is he from being able to add value in an NBA game? Is Dieng a lottery talent who simply took time to adjust to a physical league and grow into his frame? Scouts will soon flock to Australia to get a better feel for just how tough Dieng is, what type of shooter he is, and if he can be a draft-day steal or if he's closer to a KZ Okpala-caliber forward.  -- Mike Schmitz","ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the Knicks are trading No. 11 pick Ousmane Dieng to the Thunder for multiple first-round picks. Dieng grew up playing point guard before sprouting to 6-10, giving him the size to play the 2, 3 or 4 thanks to his fluidity and ability to handle, pass and shoot off the dribble, while only recently turning 19 years old. He struggled to make the transition from the French third division to the Australian NBL early, but really blossomed as the season moved on, emerging as his team's best player in the second half of the season. Gaining strength, improving as a spot-up shooter and maximizing his explosiveness and ability to play through contact on both ends likely makes him more of a long-term prospect than an immediate NBA contributor at this stage, but Dieng's two-way versatility and budding upside gives him significant potential to grow into down the road, while playing the most coveted position in the modern NBA. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jalen Williams",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Santa Clara","SCU",NA,NA,NA,"May 24, 2022: (Winners and losers of the 2022 NBA draft combine) -- With the majority of top executives evaluating him live for the first time, the 21-year-old Santa Clara wing Williams made a strong impression with his play in Chicago, looking like a surefire first-round pick thanks to his combination of size, length, skill and two-way impact. Williams averaged 15 points, 4 rebounds and 1 assist in 24.1 minutes over two games while shooting 75% from the field. Playing predominantly on the ball at Santa Clara as one of the most efficient pick-and-roll creators in the NCAA, it was valuable to see Williams thrive in a variety of different roles alongside other collegiate stars.  Given that Williams is unlikely to be handed the keys to a team at the NBA level, watching him add value as a screener, cutter, downhill driver off the catch and defender was a welcomed sight, especially when you couple that with his ambidextrous court vision and pace as a primary ball handler. Williams whipped the ball all over the floor with either hand, stretched out for a few poster dunks thanks to his 7-2 wingspan and 39-inch vertical, and played with good energy defensively. He turned down a few rhythm 3s before eventually turning the ball over and is still turning himself into a consistent shooter from beyond the arc (35% on his career), which is important, as he's not overly quick off the bounce. Williams more than proved his West Coast Conference production will have no problem translating to the NBA, and he deserves real consideration in the top 25 or so come June. -- Mike Schmitz January 26, 2022: (Stock Watch) -- Williams made a strong impression on the 40-plus scouts and handful of NBA decision makers gathered in Las Vegas for the West Coast Conference tournament on Monday night as the junior capped off his breakout season with 15 points and six assists in a narrow loss to Saint Mary's, making several NBA reads in the process. At 6-6 with a 7-0 wingspan, an NBA frame, ball skills, passing feel, a projectable shooting stroke and defensive potential, Williams is the type of prospect who could surely improve his stock throughout the pre-draft process should he opt to enter.  Williams is a late bloomer in the truest sense of the term. The Phoenix native stood no taller than 5-11 his junior year of high school before ultimately sprouting to 6-3, 180 pounds as a senior, eventually signing with Santa Clara as the Broncos staff coveted his feel, skill level and physical upside as a combo guard. He shot up to 6-5 and functioned as an energy athlete on the wing during his freshman season, eventually catching our eye at the WCC tournament in 2020 while looking like a potential three-and-done prospect given his combination of defense, passing feel, and shooting potential. Two years later and Williams just put a bow on one of the more complete college basketball seasons finishing the year averaging 18.0 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 4.1 assists while shooting 56% from 2 and 41% from 3. For reference, no other player in the country reached those marks with at least that level of efficiency. Now with wing tools at his disposal, Williams has tapped back into the handle, passing feel and skill that he honed as an undersized guard at Perry High School in Arizona. Among players to use at least 300 pick-and-roll possessions both as a scorer and passer, Williams generated the second-most efficient offense in the country. With guards fighting over screens because of the threat of his pull-up 3, Williams is excellent at putting his defender in jail, toying with the dropping big defender before either pulling up for a floater, bouncing out for a mid-range jumper, or hitting the big in stride. He's proven more than capable of hitting the roller off a live dribble from all different angles, a skill that should come to light even more with NBA talent around him. Williams isn't overly quick or shifty with the ball, and he can be a bit too finesse at times, relying on touch shots rather than striding it out to the rim. He's also had stretches during the season where he's simply not aggressive enough, blending in too often. Defensively, he's regularly taken on the challenge of slowing opposing WCC guards, using his length and smarts to keep the ball in front, contest jumpers, and blow-up handoffs. With that said, he's very ball-oriented in those situations, and isn't nearly the rebounder or off-ball playmaker he could be. Sitting next to Santa Clara's bench in Vegas, you could overhear coach Herb Sendek shout, ""Hey Jalen, you've gotta guard. No excuses."" But even if he gets hit on too many screens and has his occasional lapses, the footwork, strength, length and ticker are there to be a plus on that end of the floor while functioning as a spot shooter and secondary ball handler offensively. As we're seeing with Chicago Bulls rookie Ayo Dosunmu -- an excellent prototype for Williams to follow -- there's clear value in long-armed perimeter players who can hold their own defensively, make heady pick-and-roll reads, and make enough spot 3s to keep the defense honest. Although he was more of a sharpshooter than Williams in college, Shake Milton is another player who comes to mind when projecting the Santa Clara star, as neither is overly dynamic with the ball yet both are big, long and skilled enough to add value on and off the ball. With most NBA decision makers are just now familiarizing themselves with Williams, he's far from a lock in 2022, and there's certainly another jump for him to make should he return for his senior season. Yet, a strong pre-draft process and a stellar combine performance against the type of high-major defenders he doesn't face in the WCC could help vault him into the first-round conversation. -- Mike Schmitz ","With the third of their three lottery picks following a draft-night trade to acquire Ousmane Dieng from the New York Knicks and after solidifying their frontcourt with Chet Holmgren, the Thunder continued to stockpile talent by adding yet another young talent in Williams. Oklahoma City has one of the most promising rosters in the NBA and have the freedom to continue to build at whatever pace they deem fit, developing their picks through a steady dose of minutes and touches.  Williams was one of the big winners of the pre-draft process, boosting his stock through strong play at the NBA combine, as well as outstanding measurements, interviews and private workouts. Standing just 5-11 as a high school junior, the Santa Clara product played mostly point guard in college, but boasts a 7'2 1/4 wingspan that exceeds that of some NBA centers, giving him strong multi-positional versatility in the modern league. He converted 40% of his 3-pointers this season, shows strong instincts defensively off the ball, and has a strong feel for the game that should allow him to play in a variety of lineup configurations and roles. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jalen Duren",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Memphis","MEM",NA,NA,NA,"March 21, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Where they rank following first weekend of NCAA tournament) -- While Memphis put up an impressive fight against No. 1 overall seed Gonzaga and projected No. 1 pick Holmgren, Duren wasn't able to move the needle with his individual play, battling foul trouble on his way to seven points, seven rebounds on 3-for-11 shooting in 19 minutes.  Duren used his powerful 250-pound frame to wedge Holmgren under the rim on the offensive glass several times, leading to four offensive rebounds -- his best NBA skill at this stage. He took advantage of a Holmgren flop for an explosive dunk out of the post. He finished a lob well above the rim that was far more indicative of the type of spacing he'll have at the next level. He made a couple heady high-low passes. He also stymied guard Andrew Nembhard on a couple switches, recovered well to Holmgren out of short roll situations to take away shot attempts and put together a couple strong defensive possessions on Drew Timme, who still found ways to score in the midst of an unbelievable display of tough shot-making.  Duren struggled to finish around the rim against Holmgren's length both on put-backs and post isolations, not always going up with the amount of ferocity as his tools suggest. He forced up a contested mid-range jumper halfway through the shot clock that missed. He committed avoidable fouls on the glass, as a screener and reaching on the perimeter. Duren also had underwhelming moments guarding in space, which was also the case against Boise State. For as vertically explosive as he is, Duren doesn't have great technique defending away from the rim, as he doesn't sit down in a stance like he could and often opens his hips too quickly. His urgency on both ends still fluctuates, as he doesn't always sprint the floor, and he'll get boxed out of shot-blocking situations with deep seals defensively. Although he was unable to completely outplay Holmgren and put together a true signature performance, Duren has shown enough to warrant his standing as a potential pick between No. 6-10. Getting to know Duren personally and determining whether or not he can be more than a run-and-jump big will go a long way in deciding just how high the 18-year-old big man with Dwight Howard-like tools will ultimately go, and if he can be more than an NBA starter. -- Mike Schmitz March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- The youngest player projected to be drafted, Duren has played some of his best basketball of the season as of late, helping Memphis surge into the postseason. His combination of physical tools (6-foot-11, 250 pounds, 7-foot-5 wingspan), power, explosiveness and budding skill is unmatched. And the way his intensity has ramped up substantially while the game has simultaneously slowed down for him is extremely intriguing for a player who won't turn 19 until November. Duren has emerged as a major force inside the paint on both ends of the floor -- be it crashing the glass, protecting the rim or finishing ferociously and with incredible ease around the basket -- giving him a ready-made role to step into early in his NBA career.  Scouts will be watching how Duren looks as the competition level ramps up in the NCAA tournament and he is thrust outside of his comfort zone by different types of frontcourt matchups. Foul trouble and turnovers have been an issue at times this season, exposing his youth and lack of experience. -- Jonathan Givony March 9, 2022: (Stock Watch) -- After starting 9-8, Memphis is now one of the hottest teams in the country, winners of 10 of their last 11 games, which likely cemented their credentials for an NCAA tournament bid. Duren has been playing some of his best basketball of the season in that stretch, an uptick that is perhaps not a surprise considering he turned 18 in November and is the youngest player projected to be drafted. Duren's scoring, rebounding and free throw attempts are all up, and he's generally played harder and been much more effective on the defensive end as the year has moved on. Duren should have a ready-made role early in his NBA career, not all that different than the one he plays at Memphis, where he anchors an outstanding defense while providing a presence offensively as a rim-runner, cutter, offensive rebounder and pick and roll finisher. Ranking fourth in dunks among players projected to be drafted, Duren is one of the best finishers in this draft class, thanks to his reliable hands, terrific quickness getting off his feet, and 7-foot-5 wingspan, which provides a huge catch radius for his guards to throw lob passes to. He's still figuring out the nuances and timing of setting physical screens and rolling to the rim purposefully, but is making strides in this area and has had some incredible highlights this season showing his unique combination of speed, power and explosiveness, which will only be amplified further when surrounded by better passers as his career moves on.  Duren has some limitations from a skill and feel standpoint, making 60% of his free throws, averaging more than twice as many turnovers as assists, and showing little semblance of a post game, but has made progress in these departments during and is recently beginning to knock down mid-range jumpers with more consistency, as well as dropping occasional flashes of vision and creativity as a passer. Defensively, Duren is one of the best shot-blockers in this draft class, regularly meeting opponents at the summit in verticality situations, while also showing impressive flashes of switchability on the perimeter. He covers ground exceptionally well, is difficult to post up with his chiseled frame, and has been a force rotating out to the perimeter to contest jumpers thanks to his mobility, length, and sheer quickness getting off the ground. Duren is still a work in progress in a technical sense, as his awareness is average, the game can move a little fast for him at times, and foul trouble has been an issue against some of the better teams Memphis has played. He's a better offensive rebounder than defensive due to his just-decent physicality putting a body on stronger opponents and the fact that he can't always track loose balls coming off the rim quickly enough.  In a draft class almost entirely devoid of true centers worthy of first-round consideration, Duren's physical tools, youth, defensive versatility, finishing prowess and budding offensive skill certainly stands out. Considering the fact that Duren should still be in high school, it's safe to say that this has been a very good developmental season for him and he's likely done what he needed to justify his standing as a top-10 prospect in this draft.  -- Jonathan Givony","Charlotte hasn't won a playoff series since the Baron Davis era in 2002, with the remnants of a team that eventually became the New Orleans Pelicans. With their last playoff appearance coming in 2016, the Hornets are still searching for a new coach, trying to break free of a mediocre stretch that saw them finish just high enough in the standings to prevent them from accumulating significant lottery odds. The basketball gods smiled on them in 2020 when they vaulted from No. 8 to No. 3, allowing them to select eventual Rookie of the Year LaMelo Ball. Two years later, the Hornets still have a ways to go in surrounding their prodigious talent with the defensive personnel and finishers needed to fully unleash his passing and scoring ability, especially in the frontcourt.   ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the Charlotte Hornets were trading No. 13 pick, Jalen Duren, to the Detroit Pistons. Duren is the youngest prospect in the draft, but also arguably the most physically gifted big man in the class, at 6-10, 250 pounds with a 7-5 wingspan. Drawing comparisons to a young Dwight Howard, Duren is a powerful, spectacular leaper who increasingly emerged as a force inside the paint on both ends of the floor with his ferocious finishing ability and the quickness with which he gets off his feet for offensive rebounds and blocks. He has a ready-made role from day one as a lob-catching, shot-blocker with the huge catch radius he displays, the excellent timing he shows as a rim-protector and the way he uses verticality to his advantage.   While the game moved too fast for him at times at Memphis, Duren made strides with his intensity level and flashes of skill he showed in conference play, dropping hints of passing prowess out of short roll situations and the ability to make mid-range jumpers in small doses. Despite Memphis' lack of a point guard, Duren ranks fourth in this draft class in dunks. His skill level still has room to grow as evidenced by the 63% he shot from the free throw line and the fact that he only took one 3-pointer this season, something he'll attempt to build on as his career moves on to become a more versatile offensive player. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Ochai Agbaji",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kansas","KU",NA,NA,NA," March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Agbaji has been one of the NCAA's most consistent players, reaching double figures in scoring and knocking down at least one 3-pointer in 32 of 33 games while also converting a remarkable 75% of his shots at the rim. Standing 6-foot-6 with a 6-foot-10 wingspan and an NBA-level bounce, Agbaji is one of nine players in the NCAA shooting over 40% from 3 on at least 6.5 attempts per game, and he's doing so while adding value defensively and ranking in the top 25 in scoring. Having already played over 1,500 NCAA minutes despite not turning 22 until late April, Agbaji is the type of experienced wing poised for a signature performance or two in March.  Although he is as proven a talent as you'll find in the lottery, Agbaji has no shortage of elite prospects in the Midwest region -- Davis, Murray, Tari Eason, Smith -- whom he could go toe-to-toe with to further improve his draft stock. Scouts will be watching his ballhandling and passing to try to determine if he projects as more than a 3-and-D style wing, as over 50% of his offense comes by way of transition and spot-ups.  -- Mike Schmitz January 26, 2022: (Mock Draft) -- Following in the footsteps of upperclassmen such as Chris Duarte, Corey Kispert and Davion Mitchell last year, Agbaji is using his senior season to propel himself into lottery conversations with a first-team All-America-caliber campaign. Agbaji initially entered the 2021 draft but elected to return to Kansas after an underwhelming showing at the NBA Combine that left him no guarantees he'd hear his name called. He's since developed into a national player of the year candidate, establishing himself as arguably the best shooter in college basketball (62-for-132, 47% from 3) while leading Kansas to a top-5 ranking and 16-2 record. While Agbaji started previous seasons hot, then cooled off significantly once Big 12 play rolled around, he only seems to be getting better as the 2021-22 season moves on. He comes off a career-high 37-point effort in a double-overtime win over Texas Tech, a top-five defense per KenPom. He's been just as efficient against top-tier competition as he has against low-level opponents, a great sign for the Jayhawks as they prepare for a huge week that includes two top-10 opponents in Kentucky (Saturday, 6 p.m. ET, ESPN) and Baylor. Agbaji is physically ideal for an NBA wing, measuring 6-foot-6, 215 pounds with a 6-foot-10 wingspan and a 42-inch vertical leap. He's turned himself into one of the most dynamic shooters in the draft, regularly pulling up off the dribble in transition, setting his feet quickly while ducking behind handoffs and showing deep range and zero hesitation stepping into open 3s with his feet set, either on the hop or the 1-2 step. Agbaji's inconsistent free-throw shooting (69% this season and for his college career) leave some question marks about how sustainable his scorching shooting is, but the confidence he's exuding at the moment, especially in clutch situations, and the level of difficulty of attempts is hard to argue with. While not an advanced ball-handler or passer, Agbaji has been highly efficient operating inside the arc as well, converting 58% of his 2-pointers and turning the ball over on a miniscule 8.5% of his possessions. He makes just enough plays handling in transition, attacking closeouts with his head up and using his strong frame to draw fouls and play above the rim to not be labeled strictly a shooter. He still has work to do on his skill level, but the progress Agbaji has made over the past few years has been remarkable. The defensive end is where Agbaji initially established himself as an NBA prospect, which makes sense considering his build and ability to slide between checking guards, wings and big men in undersized Kansas' switch-heavy system. He's been inconsistent in that area this season, which is partially explained by the heavy minutes and usage he's asked to shoulder offensively. Agbaji is very effective defensively in 1-on-1 situations and makes spectacular plays at times when rotating from the weakside to protect the rim, but does lack a degree of awareness and reaction speed in processing things happening off the ball at times. He's prone to biting on shot-fakes and getting back-cut and is not the rebounder you might expect considering his tools. Agbaji has positioned himself to be the first upperclassman hearing his name called on draft night and fits a mold NBA teams are looking for as a prolific shooting wing who guards multiple positions and can do a little more than just make open shots offensively. How he finishes will be important, but it's increasingly difficult to overlook the spectacular season Agbaji is having. -- Jonathan Givony ","After three years in the NBA's cellar following the departure of LeBron James to the LA Lakers, the Cavs made an incredible turnaround, doubling their win total from last season and flirted with homecourt advantage in the playoffs before a disastrous stretch of injuries sabotaged their season. The emergence of Darius Garland as one of the league's best young point guards, the addition of rookie Evan Mobley -- a future Defensive Player of the Year candidate -- along with Jarrett Allen's All-Star campaign, were the main factors in the Cavs' resurgence. Continuing to add outside shooting, especially on the wing, appears to be a major priority for the Cavs this offseason, with a big decision looming regarding Collin Sexton's free agency as well as a potential return for Ricky Rubio.  Agbaji is one of the best shooters in the draft and projects as a plug-and-play, 3-and-D prospect who can guard multiple positions with his length, strength and experience, with nearly 4,000 minutes of college basketball under his belt. The 22-year-old All-American and the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player for national champion Kansas, Agbaji should be ready to contribute immediately after shooting 41% from 3 last season, while holding his own defensively with his 6-10 wingspan and chiseled frame. He turned himself into one of the most dynamic shooters in the draft this season, regularly pulling up off the dribble in transition, setting his feet quickly while ducking behind handoffs and showing deep range and zero hesitation stepping into open 3s with his feet set, either on the hop or the 1-2 step. Just an average ball handler and passer and prone to lapses defensively off the ball due to his just-decent feel for the game, Agbaji doesn't share the same upside as some prospects in this class, but fits a clear mold and role every NBA team is actively seeking. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Mark Williams",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Duke","DUKE","Williams' strengths are clear-cut: He's a high-level rim protector, vertical spacer and tremendous offensive rebounder, making him an easy fit at the NBA level. Williams' 7-foot-7 wingspan allows him to change all types of shots at the rim and is a huge reason he's blocking 5.3 shots per 40 minutes so far this season, which ranks third among prospects in the ESPN Top 100. He's proven capable as a pick-and-roll drop defender when fully engaged, using his defensive range and timing to swallow up guards in the paint. He's also shown glimpses as a switch defender when he fully understands the scouting report and gives himself enough space to contain the guard yet remain close enough to contest.  Offensively, Williams puts his huge reach to good use both as a finisher and offensive rebounder. He's already mastered the tap-out to create extra possessions, and his 13.2 offensive rebounding percentage is one of the best in the country. Even more valuable is his lob-catching, as his catch radius is up there with some of the most impressive in the NBA and he's converting an incredible 73.5% of his shots at the rim in the half-court, good for 5th in the NCAA behind names like Walker Kessler (Auburn), Oscar Tshiebwe (Kentucky) and David Roddy (Colorado State). He's hammered home lobs from all different angles, either ferociously slamming home passes or simply guiding the ball through the net with finesse. The fact that Williams has sound shooting mechanics (75% on free throws) and can make occasional high-low and backdoor reads is the cherry on top of an already NBA-ready shot-blocker and lob-catcher. ","The biggest question Williams has to answer is whether or not he'll get played off the floor against small-ball teams in the NBA. While agile, he's no stranger to getting caught upright in pick-and-roll, leaving him little margin for error both in drops and on switches. He's also not always the most physical 1-on-1 defender, too often allowing deep catches or simply letting far less talented bigs spin past him for easy buckets. His balance and physicality leave something to be desired, which shows both as a finisher, interior defender and defensive rebounder at times. With every NBA team looking for ball-handling, passing bigs in the Banchero mold, Williams still has questions to answer in those areas. Even if he's already a better passer than some rim-running bigs, he can still stand to sharpen his short-roll reads and learn the nuances of igniting possessions with dribble-handoffs. Although he has a clear role, modernizing his game on both ends will be important. Comps at the next level (ceiling/floor) There aren't many players in the NBA with Williams' sheer length (7-7 wingspan), yet there is no shortage of effective centers who have carved out a role as lob-catching, shot-blocking bigs. Mitchell Robinson comes to mind as a tall, mobile 5 who has a huge catch radius and can put a lid on the rim defensively. Williams isn't quite as agile on the perimeter as Robinson, while the Knicks' big man never showed the same glimpses of passing as Duke's 20-year-old sophomore.  Robert Williams, who was a potential lottery pick if it weren't for injury red flags, would be an excellent possible projection for Mark Williams. The Celtics center has emerged as one of the league's most underrated bigs thanks to his combination of lob-catching, rebounding, rim protection and passing. Like Boston's starting center, Mark Williams has a similarly massive standing reach, can block jump shots like few bigs in all of basketball, and is also somewhat underrated in his ability to make basic reads on the perimeter. If Williams' passing never materializes, JaVale McGee, who has started over 350 NBA games at age 34, is a relatively stable outcoe for the Blue Devils first-rounder. Optimal/practical NBA team fits: Williams makes a lot of sense for teams that don't rely on playing through their center too much on the perimeter. Basically, teams that have had success with run-and-jump- style bigs in the past. The Mavericks come to mind, as Luka Doncic hasn't quite had a lob threat and rim protector like Williams since playing with Edy Tavares in Real Madrid. The Rockets make some sense, as Williams would give young guards like Jalen Green and Josh Christopher a lob threat they currently don't have in Alperen Sengun or Christian Wood. Although his fit with Sengun is a little questionable, Williams would immediately give the NBA's worst defense a face-lift in the rim protection department.  The Thunder and their treasure-trove of picks also make some sense as Williams' vertical spacing would further unlock Josh Giddey and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's playmaking, and he gives the Thunder -- who have been playing Jeremiah Robinson-Earl at center -- a dimension its roster currently doesn't have. The Spurs don't have a big in Williams' mold on their roster, and they hold three picks in the top-20. Gregg Popovich traditionally likes bigs who can transfer the ball side to side and keep the offense flowing, but Williams certainly fills a need if the Spurs buy his potential as a passer, at least to the level of a Jakob Poeltl-type. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,"May 24, 2022: (Winners and losers of the 2022 NBA draft combine) -- Williams' 9-foot-9 standing reach will officially make the Duke center the longest player in the NBA, and our historical measurement database, the moment he steps foot on the floor, edging out Mo Bamba (9-7.5), Rudy Gobert (9-7) and Boban Marjanovic (9-7). Williams' sheer reach immediately makes him a game-changer as both a lob-catcher and rim-protector, elements we saw all season in the ACC as he finished a remarkable 76% of his shots at the rim in the half court. Williams also ranks No. 3 among our top 100 in block percentage and fourth in offensive rebound percentage, regularly creating extra possessions with tap-outs thanks to his timing and length. On top of all that, the fact that Williams weighed in at 242 pounds despite having considerable room to fill out his frame (5.4% body fat) bodes well for the 20-year-old, as he's not the most physical big man out there. Expect Williams to generate significant interest throughout the lottery, potentially even leapfrogging fellow center Jalen Duren. -- Mike Schmitz March 28, 2022: (Final Four week mock draft) -- Williams was the most impactful player on the floor in the Elite Eight, and he is in the midst of a phenomenal NCAA tournament, posting 58 points, 35 rebounds and 16 blocks in his four-game run to the Final Four, hitting 25 of 31 shots in that span, 13 of which have been dunks.  He is a game-changer on both ends of the floor with his combination of size (7-foot-1) and length (7-foot-8 wingspan), providing a steady offensive presence with his excellent hands, finishing ability and rim protection thanks to his mobility, timing and reach. He is constantly throwing his body around in the paint and hustling to keep plays alive with an insatiable intensity level. Williams' upright stance guarding on the perimeter, occasional struggles with physicality navigating screens and mediocre timing tracking loose balls off the defensive glass weren't as much of an issue this past weekend as they've been in the past. His lack of passing ability (zero assists in the past three games) and shooting range aren't ideal for a big man projecting to the modern NBA game, but there's a clear role for a 20-year-old, lob-catching, rim-protecting center who plays hard and still has room to improve. It will be an interesting litmus test to see how much the NBA values a center in Williams' mold these days, as a decade ago there would be no question that he'd be an easy top-10 pick. It wouldn't be surprising to see Williams still emerge as a lottery candidate, and it's hard to envision him falling out of the top 20 as long as his pre-draft process doesn't reveal any red flags. -- Jonathan Givony March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Williams' 7-foot-1, 242-pound frame and 7-foot-7 wingspan certainly stand out at the college level. The ACC defensive player of the year is one of the best shot-blockers in this draft class and brings a consistent presence as a vertical spacer and an offensive rebounder for Duke, finishing 71% of his field goal attempts, with nearly half of those makes coming on dunks. Williams isn't quite as feared defensively as you might expect considering his accolades, as you frequently see opposing teams post him up or challenge him in the pick-and-roll, where he's still a major work in progress. His upright stance on the perimeter and struggles covering ground fluidly are question marks projecting to the NBA level, as is the fact that the game simply moves too fast for him at times on both ends of the floor. -- Jonathan Givony February 25, 2022: (Projecting Duke players) -- ","As reported by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Hornets are trading the No. 13 pick, Jalen Duren, to the Detroit Pistons. The Hornets could have gone in a lot of different directions -- additional frontcourt help, depth on the wing with Gordon Hayward's uncertain health status, or another guard to play alongside and behind the versatile LaMelo Ball. Trade rumors swirled here for weeks leading up to the draft, as many around the NBA believed the front office didn't have an appetite to add another rookie to the rotation after a somewhat surprising coaching change indicated the team has higher hopes than just making the NBA play-in game.   Standing 7-2, Williams is a huge physical outlier, with a 9-9 standing reach that will make him the longest player in the NBA. He was an absolute game-changer at Duke on both ends of the floor with the non-stop energy he offers, providing a steady offensive presence with his excellent hands and finishing ability and putting a lid on the rim defensively thanks to his mobility, timing and reach. One of the draft's best offensive rebounders, Williams is constantly throwing his body around in the paint and hustling to keep plays alive. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","AJ Griffin",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Duke","DUKE","Griffin has prototype tools for an NBA wing at 6-6 with a strong, proportionate 222-pound frame and a 7-0 wingspan. He's a powerful two-foot leaper in space and, while not quite as tall as the 6-8 combo forwards in the Jimmy Butler mold, his strength, length and incredibly strong base allows him to play much bigger than his height. Griffin has a clear-cut NBA skill with his shooting as he's converting a remarkable 48.1% of his triples while ranking 5th in the entire NCAA in catch and shoot efficiency. Despite a wide base and not the most traditional mechanics, Griffin is as close to automatic as you'll see from an 18-year-old with his physical tools. Griffin has shown the ability to get to step back 3s with through the legs moves on occasion and he's comfortable rising into mid-range pull-ups as well. Griffin is a relatively comfortable ball handler, mixing in smooth in-and-out dribbles and crossovers to get downhill. So, while he's best known for his deep 3s and shredded frame, Griffin has shown glimpses of versatility, even operating off of pindowns at times and adding value as a cutter, which is one of his best skills when fully engaged. Although more score-first, he's a capable passer after closeout attacks, evidence by the tape and his positive assist to turnover ratio.  Defensively, Griffin also has a chance to be highly impactful and versatile, even if he's still learning the nuances of on and off ball defense at this stage of his development. He's tough to move in the post thanks to his low center of gravity and frame and has shown the ability to blow up handoffs and deny wing entries with a deep stance and active hands. When you consider that Griffin is capable of sliding up to the small-ball 4 defensively while providing spacing as a shooter offensively, it's easy to see why he has a relatively high floor. Add in the flashes of shot creation and the fact that he would be one of the youngest players in the draft and there's an argument to be made that, especially given the coveted position he plays, Griffin has as much upside as any of Duke's prospects. ","Griffin entered his freshman season trying to do too much offensively, leading to questions about his feel for the game and skill level. Hungry to prove he was more than just a big bodied wing, the game was moving too quickly for Griffin on both ends of the floor. Griffin's naysayers question his decision making and wonder how he's adding value when he's not making shots. Offensively, Griffin isn't immune to a missed drop off or kick out pass, and he's two-foot reliant, not nearly as explosive playing off of one. Despite the gaudy percentages, is the nature of Griffin's release going to allow him to be consistent offensively? Will he be able to sprint around screens and get square in the air like we see from some of the best shooters? Defensively, Griffin's discipline and awareness are question marks. He can be a bit too ball oriented, losing sight of his man and allowing open 3s or back cuts. He's not the forceful rebounder he could be, with some scouts questioning his toughness. Griffin will take aggressive angles on the ball too often, allowing straight line drives to the rim more than you'd hope from a prospect with defensive stopper potential. With a history of knee injuries, NBA scouts wonder whether or not Griffin will get medically red-flagged throughout the pre-draft process. Comps at the next level (ceiling/floor): Although they have a very different shot profile at the same stage, Jaylen Brown comes to mind as a best-case outcome for Griffin. While Brown shot just 30% from 3 at California and that's Griffin's clear NBA skill, the two hold some physical similarities and question marks in terms of decision making. Like Brown as an 18-year-old, Griffin has the tools to be a multi-positional defender who can hang his hat on that end of the floor early in his career. Griffin, like a teenage Brown, is also an underrated ball handler relative to his frame and length, which gives him similar upside as a shot creator that Brown's biggest naysayers didn't believe he had. OG Anunoby is a name that comes to mind as a solid mid-range outcome for Griffin. Although not quite as big, long and powerful, Griffin can offer similar defensive versatility and floor spacing while building out his shot creation slowly. Patrick Williams is another physical combo forward who rose in the pre-draft process due to his age, tools, and glimpses of skill. While an inch or two shorter, Griffin is just as powerful with a far more refined skill set at the same stage. Optimal/practical NBA team fits: There are no shortage of NBA teams in need of a two-way wing who can space the floor, making the list of theoretical suitors for Griffin arguably the longest amongst Duke prospects. The team that comes to mind most for me is Sacramento, which has been in the market for a rangy wing for years. Griffin would fit perfectly alongside De'Aaron Fox, Davion Mitchell, and Domantas Sabonis, and could learn from a pro like Harrison Barnes (even if he's a Tar Heel). Griffin would also be an interesting fit next to Pacers guards Tyrese Haliburton and Chris Duarte, giving Indiana a level of pop those two lack on the perimeter, while being able to add value without needing much volume given his spot shooting. With two picks in the top-10, the upstart Trail Blazers also make some sense here, with Griffin as an exciting young fit next to Anfernee Simons. Should they fall out of the Banchero-Jabari Smith-Chet Holmgren sweepstakes, Griffin would give Giddey and Gilgeous-Alexander a valuable young wing defender who can knock down open 3s and potential evolve into the Thunder's missing piece on the perimeter.  -- Mike Schmitz",NA,"March 28, 2022: (Final Four week mock draft) -- Griffin has been very much a mixed bag in March (including the ACC tournament), and it was important for him to get back on track after three NCAA tournament games in which he posted just 28 points on 25 field goal attempts while contributing little outside of his remarkable perimeter shooting.  Griffin did so in a major way against Arkansas, leading Blue Devils in scoring with 18 points and showing some flashes of shot-creation, but he still had some poor moments defensively and looked limited as a passer and decision-maker. Griffin is in the midst of one of the best perimeter shooting seasons ever from an 18-year-old freshman, converting 46% of his 3-pointers, many of which come on difficult pull-ups and step-back jumpers. The spacing he provides Duke's offense from the perimeter along with his ability to manufacture offense while attacking closeouts and out of complicated ballhandling sequences have been important factors in Duke advancing to the Final Four. He hit 5 of 10 3-pointers against two of the best defenses in the country in Texas Tech and Arkansas this past weekend. Griffin's weaknesses also were on display, as he doesn't have the most functional handle, often needing too many dribbles to get into his jumper, rarely getting to the free throw line, lacking great explosiveness and frequently turning the ball over when faced with help defenders coming with strong digs from the weak side. His passing and overall feel for the game are major question marks at this point, as is his ability to impact the game when his jumpers aren't falling. Defensively, the game clearly moves too fast for him at this stage, as he often is a step late with his reaction time, is prone to falling asleep or gambling out of his stance and struggles with the nuances of off-ball defense. The question NBA teams will ask is how much of that is to be expected considering Griffin's youth and the fact that he barely played any competitive basketball in his final two years of high school due to injury and the pandemic. Wing players with his build, length and shot-making are very difficult to come by, and Griffin had some massive games for Duke this season after initially being on a short leash due to his lack of experience and mistake-prone nature on both ends of the floor. While Griffin's pedigree and background intel (coaches uniformly rave about his approach) will help, medicals also will play a major role in where he is drafted, as he has struggled to stay healthy for significant parts of his career. In the meantime, going out on as strong a note as possible in the Final Four next weekend certainly wouldn't hurt. -- Jonathan Givony  March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Griffin is one of the best shooters in college, converting 47% of his 3s while ranking third in catch-and-shoot efficiency among high-volume shooters at high-major programs. Griffin has the type of physical profile NBA teams covet on the perimeter at 6-goot-6 and 225 pounds with a 7-foot wingspan. NBA teams will be closely monitoring whether the 18-year-old can put those tools to use on both ends of the floor, as he too often settles for perimeter jumpers and isn't nearly the type of versatile defender and rebounder his frame and length suggest he should be. After attempting just 2.3 free throws per 40 minutes in 34 games, Griffin -- who has looked like a potential top-five pick at times and at others a one-dimensional gunner -- must demonstrate he is more than just a standstill shooter and a willing, engaged defender. -- Mike Schmitz February 25, 2022: (Projecting Duke players) -- ","The Hawks were perhaps the NBA's best story in 2021, advancing all the way to the conference finals behind star guard Trae Young and a deep core of contributors surrounding him that provided significant optimism for the team's future. Alas, running back mostly the same roster resulted in very different results last season, as the team narrowly squeaked into the playoffs and were barely competitive in a gentlemen's sweep against Miami, causing the front office to need to completely rethink the construction of the team around Young after finishing with the league's fourth-worst defense. The Hawks were one of the NBA's most active teams in trade conversations leading up to draft night, exploring a variety of scenarios involving trading high into the lottery, out of the draft altogether, and moving several core players in a bid to improve the team's competitiveness and chemistry.  Griffin is arguably the best shooter in this draft class, converting 45% of his 3-pointers this season while showing the ability to hit difficult step backs and pullups. Griffin has an ideal physical profile for a wing, standing 6-6, 225 pounds and a 7-foot wingspan that should allow him to slide to the power forward spot with relative ease. He's one of the youngest prospects in this draft, not turning 19 until late August with considerable upside to grow into after missing much of his last two years of high school, putting him at a major disadvantage early in the season at Duke. Griffin's average ballhandling, passing and inability to get to the free throw line, and lapses in focus and intensity off the ball defensively made him a somewhat polarizing prospect for scouts to evaluate. His biggest fans point to his terrific pedigree (the son of long-time NBA player and coach Adrian Griffin), youth and the impressive sparks of potential he showed at various points in the season as reasons to be much more bullish on his potential, ultimately helping him get selected. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Tari Eason",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"LSU","LSU",NA,NA,NA," March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Eason wasn't particularly well-known upon transferring from Cincinnati to LSU, but he made the transition to the most talented conference in college basketball look easy in emerging as a first-team All-SEC player, scoring in bunches and filling up the box score despite coming off the bench. Eason has improved his ballhandling and perimeter shooting considerably while putting consistent pressure on opposing defenses with his quick first step, physicality and insatiable intensity, allowing him to live at the free throw line. These same traits help make him one of the most versatile defenders in college, a magnet for steals, blocks and rebounds who flies all over the floor in LSU's suffocating press while rotating from guarding point guards to big men. Eason's passing ability, decision-making and still-streaky jumper are question marks scouts will want to gather more information about in the NCAA tournament, as he sees most of his minutes at center but isn't particularly big or bulky at 6-foot-8 and 216 pounds. LSU was delivered a major blow when Eason's coach, Will Wade, was dismissed Saturday due to recruiting violation allegations, and the Tigers will need their best player to emerge as a leader on and off the court. -- Jonathan Givony March 9, 2022: (Stock Watch) -- Despite coming off the bench nearly every game, Eason has established himself as an SEC player of the year candidate, even if his persistent foul trouble and averaging 24 minutes per game will likely work against him.  Three months ago, we expressed a degree of concern about LSU's poor non-conference schedule and how Eason's productivity might translate to the rigors of SEC play. Eason has been just as effective in conference play than outside it, emerging as LSU's clear go-to guy while maintaining sparkling scoring efficiency and emerging as arguably the SEC's most versatile defender. Perhaps most notable for Eason is his shooting, converting 18-for-41 attempts from beyond the arc (44%) in 18 games. Despite somewhat awkward shooting mechanics, releasing the ball from his right shoulder, Eason's confidence has never been higher, especially as of late (13-for-27 his last 10 games). He's shown some real versatility with his shot-making, taking and making plenty of difficult pull-up jumpers, while converting 79% of his free throw attempts, a place he gets to more often on a per-minute basis (9.3 per-40) than any player currently projected to be drafted besides Purdue's 7-3 Zach Edey.  Seeing most of his minutes at center, despite standing 6-8, Eason is a true mismatch at the college level, being simply too fast for slower big men to contain off the dribble, and too aggressive for wings to handle in the paint. He shows real flashes of creativity as a ball-handler in the half-court or pushing off the defensive glass, even if his passing and overall decision-making ability leaves something to be desired and can lead to some out-of-control moments. He's an explosive, highly acrobatic finisher who puts tremendous pressure on opponents with his excellent first step, polished footwork and the quickness in which he gets off his feet, helping him draw fouls in bunches while emerging as one of the most productive transition college scorers. Eason's quickness, length and instincts also shows in the way he gets in passing lanes -- he currently ranks first among projected draft picks in steals generated per-minute, while also ranking top-10 in blocks. Few players in this draft bring a higher degree of intensity to every possession than Eason, which is also reflected in his terrific rebounding numbers, and the fact that he is extremely effective switching onto guards and wings, containing opponents off the dribble and contesting jumpers on the perimeter, which is highly intriguing in today's switch-heavy NBA. The considerable jump Eason has made as a 20-year old sophomore transitioning to the most talented conference in college basketball hasn't been lost on NBA executives, and he's emerged as a real candidate for lottery consideration with his play. Background intel and a productive pre-draft process will be key for the late-bloomer, but he checks so many boxes NBA teams are looking for with his productivity, physical tools, defensive versatility, intensity and budding shooting/shot-creation. -- Jonathan Givony January 5, 2022: (Top 100) -- Despite moving up in level from Cincinnati to LSU last summer, the sophomore has been one of the breakout performers of the season thus far, averaging a remarkable 25.9 points, 12.1 rebounds, 2.5 steals and 2.3 blocks per 40 minutes on excellent efficiency (60% TS%).  Coming off the bench as an undersized center for an LSU team that faced a weak non-conference schedule (zero top-50 opponents) and relies heavily on smothering opponents with its full-court press, it's easy to see why scouts have registered a degree of skepticism about Eason's numbers. Still, there's a lot to like about the Seattle native. Most of his offense comes by hustle and instincts, be it leaking out in transition, crashing the offensive glass or ducking into the paint off cuts or as a pick-and-roll finisher. He draws plenty of fouls thanks to his intensity and by moving at a different speed than most players, and has converted 79% of his free throw attempts this season (up from 57% last year) despite his awkward shooting mechanics. His 25% career 3-point percentage is something he'll have to improve on moving forward. Eason shows some ability to beat slower opponents off the bounce with long, powerful strides, solid ball-handling and interesting footwork as a finisher. He alternates between playing wild and sped-up versus making notable passes that find teammates with more creativity than you'd expect. Defensively, there's a lot to like about the quick hands and feet he shows generating turnovers, his ability to cover ground to protect the basket and the way he switches on the perimeter with his length and intensity. There are some questions about whether he has the size and bulk needed to play as much small-ball center in the NBA as he currently does, or whether he can improve his offensive polish and shooting to transition into a wing player. After he fouled out and struggled against possibly the best frontcourt in the country in Auburn's Walker Kessler and Jabari Smith, NBA scouts will be closely monitoring how Eason looks against the best of the SEC to better gauge his merits as a first-round pick. -- Jonathan Givony","The Rockets continued to cash in on the James Harden trade with this pick acquired from Brooklyn last year, one of many still owed to them in the next several seasons. With significant minutes and opportunities to offer in Houston, with few long-term keepers standing in the way, the Rockets have a chance to continue to add talent and improve their long-term outlook with this pick.  Eason seemingly came out of nowhere to emerge as a real candidate for SEC Player of the Year, despite coming off the bench for LSU. His 7-2 wingspan, massive hands and ability to be an asset in pressing, switching and trapping schemes with his quickness, instincts and activity is attractive on the defensive end. He frequently drops into passing lanes, rotates for blocks and crashes the offensive glass.  Offensively, Eason has plenty of untapped upside as evidenced by the stellar 27 points per 40 minutes he averaged last season. He knocked down 36% of his 3-pointers, converted 80% of his free throws and threw down 47 dunks, rarely having plays called for him and playing on a team that ranked second-to-last in the SEC in assists. He shows flashes of creativity as a ball handler, by creating off the dribble in the half court, and is a huge mismatch with his ability to blow by slower big men with his excellent first step, helping him get to the free throw line frequently. Cutting down on turnovers, fouls and mental lapses, as well as finding more consistency as a ball handler, shooter and decision-maker will be important for Eason to reach his potential long-term, but he checks quite a few boxes on both ends of the floor with plenty of room to continue growing. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Dalen Terry",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arizona","ARIZ",NA,NA,NA,"May 24, 2022: (Winners and losers of the 2022 NBA draft combine) -- Terry was one of the combine's biggest winners without even playing a 5-on-5 game. Officially just testing the waters, Terry is quickly emerging as a potential top-20 pick now that teams have had the opportunity to sit down with the charismatic, high-energy 19-year-old to learn more about him. League executives we spoke with consistently raved about Terry's interviews, citing his competitiveness, feel for the game and engaging personality.  Terry's intensity and infectious personality came to life during his pro day, further confirming the elite intangibles that evaluators who followed him closely raved about all season. There's surely another level Terry can reach as a player, as he averaged just 8.0 points in 27.5 minutes last season while connecting on just 28 3s in 37 games. But Terry isn't short on confidence, as he was sure to point out that he shot 47% from 3 over the last 10 games of the season when I mentioned the questions about his shooting. Although he lacks the most picturesque mechanics, Terry has already proved in workout settings that concerns about his shooting may indeed be overblown. While he won't be drafted as a go-to scorer, Terry's combination of physical tools at 6-7, 195 pounds with a 7-1 wingspan, defensive versatility, passing ability and overall willingness to do the little things that impact winning could earn him looks even as high as the lottery, sharing some similarities to a smaller Scottie Barnes in terms of his all-around impact and approach to the game. -- Mike Schmitz March 28, 2022: (Final Four week mock draft) -- Although the Wildcats' storybook season was cut short, Terry continued his outstanding March against the Cougars, finishing with 17 points on just 9 shots, 6 rebounds and 3 assists, all while flying around defensively and making several winning plays that we've grown accustomed to seeing from the energetic, 19-year-old sophomore. Arizona likely wouldn't have even been a Sweet 16 team if it wasn't for the emergence of Terry, who stepped into an on-ball role when Kerr Kriisa was injured and proved to hold together the Wildcats for long stretches given his all-around impact, motor and spirit. While some of his limitations as a half-court scorer did show in the TCU game (2-for-8 shooting from the field), he still found ways to impact winning by limiting the Horned Frogs' Mike Miles to 5-for-20 shooting, knocking down a clutch corner 3 down the stretch, collecting five steals and making heady reads in a team-high 42 minutes. After a somewhat slow start to the season, Terry was arguably Arizona's most important player down the stretch, averaging 13.0 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.4 assists and 1.8 steals in 35.5 minutes over his last five games, while shooting 54% from 2-point range, 64.3% from 3 and 85.7% from the free throw line. Terry's lack of shooting -- and half-court scoring, in general -- has long been what held him back from being considered a true 2022 NBA prospect. His is not exactly the most aesthetically pleasing shooting stroke, and he'll still turn down open looks and miss touch shots around the rim. But he has proved capable of taking and making big shots, and that has to sit well with NBA evaluators, especially when you consider he does virtually everything else well on the floor. Although not nearly as physically gifted, Terry plays with the type of kidlike joy and authenticity we've seen from prospects such as Scottie Barnes in the past. Terry already has a calling card at the next level with his defensive versatility at 6-foot-7 with a 7-foot wingspan and will positively impact any locker room he enters. Terry isn't a perfect prospect by any means, as he'll have to prove he can add enough value off the ball -- particularly as a shooter -- to coexist alongside more ball-dominant perimeter players in the NBA. But as we've seen with prospects ranging from Terance Mann to Herbert Jones, there's no shortage of wings who weren't prolific scorers or shooters in college now sticking in the NBA because of their defensive versatility, energy, feel for the game, intangibles and ability to handle and pass. There's no question Terry would benefit from returning to Arizona for another season. He is still just 19 and needs to prove he can be a consistent perimeter threat. A junior campaign averaging 15-5-5 could vault him into Pac-12 player of the year conversation and ultimately the lottery range of the 2023 draft.  With that said, there's no denying that Terry has helped himself in a big way over the past month and would surely hear his name called if he were to target this June -- potentially even earning looks in the first round with a strong pre-draft process. Terry has proved he is more than just the glue guy he was touted as early in the season, and there's certainly a world where he ends up as the best NBA player from this Arizona team down the line, depending on how he develops as a shooter. -- Mike Schmitz","The Bulls broke free of several years among the dregs of the NBA with a resurgent season sparked by the hiring of a new front office and coaching staff in 2020. Lead decision-maker Arturas Karnisovas wasted no time in putting his imprint on the roster, making several big-name additions in the form of Demar DeRozan, Nikola Vucevic and Lonzo Ball along with the shrewd signing of Alex Caruso. Injuries derailed an incredibly promising start after the All-Star break and the team now has quite a few questions to answer long-term with Zach Lavine an unrestricted free agent, Vucevic taking a major step backward and Ball continuing to struggle through injuries. With the No. 18 pick unlikely to make a significant difference on the franchise's short-term outlook, the front office was diligent in exploring trade scenarios in the lead-up to draft night, ultimately electing to keep the pick.   Terry was considered likely to return for his junior year at Arizona after testing the waters but made enough of a splash in the pre-draft process to ultimately stay in the draft, winning teams over with his outstanding personality and competitive spirit.  Terry has several things working in his favor as a prospect, starting with his intriguing dimensions at over 6-7 with a near 7-1 wingspan and 195-pound frame, which make him one of the most versatile defenders in this draft class. He plays with outstanding energy, is difficult to shoot over on the perimeter with his length, and can slide with point guards and wings alike. Terry is an excellent passer, growing up playing point guard and doing quite a bit of playmaking for Arizona all season. The development of his perimeter shooting, and overall scoring ability-- his biggest weakness as a prospect -- will play a major role in his ability to carve out a niche for himself and ultimately help determine what kind of career he has in the NBA. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jake LaRavia",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wake Forest","WAKE",NA,NA,NA,"March 9, 2022: (Stock Watch) -- While ACC Player of the Year Alondes Williams has stolen the headlines this season with his powerful downhill drives and flashy one-handed passes, there's another Demon Deacons prospect gaining steam as Wake Forest's best NBA prospect.  LaRavia is an Indiana State transfer who could make a first-round push with a strong showing at the ACC tournament, and ultimately the NCAA tournament. With Wake Forest currently projected by ESPN &#8203;&#8203;Bracketologist Joe Lunardi as a 10-seed, the Demon Deacons could use a big game or two to solidify their at-large bid to the big dance, giving LaRavia the platform to continue rising in NBA circles with signature performances against the ACC's elite. LaRavia has already proven his worth throughout the regular season, topping 40 minutes in seven games, putting 19 and 10 on Paolo Banchero and Duke and 31-10-4 on North Carolina while turning in the type of stat-stuffing, efficient season that will have analytics departments buzzing. LaRavia ranks fifth in our Top-100 in true shooting percentage, only sitting behind 7-footers such as Mark Williams, Chet Holmgren, Jamarion Sharp and Zach Edey. LaRavia is an easy fit at the highest level because of his versatility as a 6-8 modern 4. While Wake Forest isn't exactly known for its defensive intensity, LaRavia can shift between 1 through 4 for stretches, sliding with guards and wings alike while using his solid frame to battle on the interior. He can stand to get a little tougher on the defensive glass, isn't blessed with great length, and doesn't quite project as a true defensive stopper, especially against NBA-caliber perimeter players. But he plays hard, has great instincts, and knows where to be off the ball, making him a value-add on the defensive end of the floor, even in the NBA.  Offensively, you can move him all over the floor as he's capable of initiating offense in transition, functioning as a pick-and-roll ball-handler at times, playing out of the post to score or facilitate (one of his best skills), or picking and popping to space for spot 3s (40%), closeout attacks or quick reads (4.3 assists per 40 minutes). LaRavia ranks 2nd in the ACC in offensive win shares in large part due to that skill level and versatility.  Although a little bit hesitant from 3 at times (39.7%), watching LaRavia shoot the ball pregame before the NC State game recently, I have little doubt that he can make NBA 3s at a respectable clip, especially when you consider he's 20 years old. Younger than freshmen such as Kentucky's TyTy Washington, LaRavia is a late-bloomer, as he was only 6-4 when former Indiana State head coach Greg Lansing first started watching him at Lawrence Central High School in Indiana, where he was recruiting teammate Nijel Pack. LaRavia initially signed with SIU Edwardsville in the Ohio Valley, eventually de-committing after a coaching change and landed with Lansing at Indiana State, where he spent two seasons before transferring up to Wake Forest. LaRavia has a lot of the ingredients you generally see in draft risers given his intangibles, late-blooming status, skill level, feel and productivity.  Whether it's an undrafted 6-10 forward such as Dean Wade or a top-10 pick in Deni Avdija, there are players in LaRavia's mold having success in the NBA, and another big performance surely gives LaRavia more of a runway to convince scouts and evaluators that he's worthy of true first-round consideration like his productivity and versatility suggests. -- Mike Schmitz ","With a star in place in Ja Morant and a large contingent of outstanding role-players and promising young building blocks surrounding him, the Grizzlies have one of the rosiest outlooks of any team in the NBA. Add in the financial flexibility to add pieces, either in free agency or trades, several picks owed in the coming years, and continued improvement organically as Morant and the rest of the roster develops and builds chemistry, and there's a lot to be excited about for Memphis fans long-term.   According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Memphis Grizzlies are acquiring No. 19 pick Jake LaRavia from the Minnesota Timberwolves for the No. 22 and No. 29 pick in the 2022 NBA draft. LaRavia was an All-ACC player in his third season of college basketball, scoring efficiently, showing terrific passing prowess, being highly switchable defensively with his outstanding instincts and intensity and awareness off the ball, making him likely ready for NBA minutes in the not-too-distant future.   LaRavia is just 20 years old and still has some potential left to tap into as his frame improves, his quickness and explosiveness is maximized and his assertiveness as an outside shooter and overall scorer increases. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Malaki Branham",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ohio State","OSU",NA,NA,NA," March 21, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Where they rank after first weekend of the NCAA tournament) -- Branham looked like the best player on the floor against Villanova, despite only being a freshman. Ohio State has gradually shifted most of their offense to run through him as the season has progressed, and he did a great job of making shots keep the game close before the Buckeyes eventually bowed out. Branham's size, frame, length, scoring instincts and shot-making prowess off the dribble (44% FG%) and with his feet set (43%) make his game look seamlessly translatable for what the NBA is looking for at his position. He got to his spots in the mid-range and rose up beautifully with his high release point, and showed he can do a little more than that too by facilitating for others and showing competitiveness defensively one-on-one. While he has some things to work with as a ball handler and off-ball defender, the fact that he's 18 years old, has made such impressive strides as the season moved on and plays with a unique combination of aggressiveness and poise could put him in lottery conversations. -- Jonathan Givony  March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Branham is a long-armed, 6-foot-5 off guard who can score the ball at all three levels and defend his position, and he holds some untapped upside as a secondary ball handler in the Caris LeVert mold. Branham, who will turn 19 in May, has developed into the model of consistency for Ohio State, as he has scored 15 points or more in seven of his past eight games, emerging as a potential top-20 prospect in the process. He is a capable spot shooter from 3 at 42%, is elite rising up in midrange spots and is slithery downhill to the rim while also showing the ability to make some basic reads. Although he is rock solid across the board, Branham doesn't quite have that one elite skill, at least at the level of an NBA starter.  Scouts will be evaluating Branham's ballhandling and passing to discern whether they think he can play more of an on-ball role in the future, as that would greatly boost his value given that he's most impactful defending 1s and 2s. But in terms of his age, positional length (6-foot-11 wingspan), shooting and productivity, Branham checks a lot of the boxes teams look for in a young guard prospect. A deep NCAA tournament run could earn him looks in the late lottery, similar to what we saw from Joshua Primo last year. -- Mike Schmitz February 22, 2022: (Mock Draft and Top 100 update) -- Branham has gained considerable traction amongst NBA scouts as a potential one-and-done first-rounder thanks to his stellar play over the last two months. After averaging 16.0 points, 4.6 rebounds and 2.6 assists on 55% from 2 and 42% from 3 in January (8 games), Branham has carried that momentum into February by knocking down 63% of his triples over 6 games, capped off by an impressive 27-point performance on just 13 shots in an overtime win over Indiana on Monday.  I traveled to Columbus on Saturday to get a better feel for the 18-year-old freshman against Keegan Murray and Iowa, where he yet again topped 20 points with an efficient 22 points on just 13 shots. The No. 35 overall recruit in his high school class out of LeBron James' St Vincent-St Mary's High School, Branham possesses sharp overall scoring instincts which have culminated in big games against Nebraska and Bryce McGowens (35 points), Jaden Ivey and Purdue (20 points on 10 shots), Murray, and now Indiana.  Although wiry and more smooth and slithery than devastatingly quick or explosive, Branham's length stands out at first glance at around 6-5 with a 6-11 wingspan, high shoulders, and big hands. He's automatic from beyond the arc in pregame, sporting a quick, compact, and repeatable shooting stroke that's helped him score the ball efficiently both from 3 and in mid-range, where he's most comfortable. Able to play at different speeds with relative ease, Branham is more versatile scorer than standstill shooter right now, as he uses hesitations to maneuver his way to the rim and is showing more and more confidence and patience in ball screens by the game. He's made a few encouraging pocket passes as of late as well, and the fact that he can add value out of spot-ups, pindowns and occasional pick-and-rolls gives him intriguing versatility.  He's not overly physical to the rim, and can still tighten up his handle, but his combination of length, footwork and touch gives him potential as a 3-level scorer and finisher. While still improving with his discipline, technique and awareness, Branham has also shown promise on the defensive end of the floor, making it tough on highly touted Big Ten guards ranging from Johnny Davis (14 points on 18 shots) to McGowens (18 points on 19 shots). He's no stranger to getting lost off the ball or taking a bad angle as the point-of-attack defender, but he makes up for it with his near 7-foot wingspan, solid quicks and effort level.  Overall, Branham is still searching for his truly elite NBA skill as he's a good, not great shooter (regardless of the percentages), in part because of his somewhat low release that makes it easy to contest. He can get downhill and finish at the collegiate level, but he benefits from Ohio State's bigs regularly carving out space for him with deep seals around the rim, creating uncontested finishes. He can also do a better job of covering more ground with his dribble, taking sharper angles to the rim. On top of all that, Branham would benefit from becoming a more reliable and nuanced passer, which is important given that he has the frame of a lot of NBA point guards.  As it stands now, Branham has a relatively high floor as a versatile off guard who can check 1s and 2s, make spot 3s and play some second-side pick-and-roll. Yet adding more playmaking variety off the bounce would allow him to further tap into the glimpses of shot-creation he does show, potentially evolving into more of a Caris LeVert-style guard. While it initially felt like Branham was trending more toward a 2023 first-rounder, his play over the last two months has surely expedited that process, and he's trending toward becoming a legitimate option for teams drafting in the first round come June, especially if he strings together a few more signature performances with a slew of high-level decision-makers expected to set up shop in Indianapolis for the Big Ten tournament. It's not easy to find long, rangy perimeter players who can score at all 3 levels and defend multiple positions, and at just 18, Branham fits that mold.  - Mike Schmitz ","With the second of three first-rounders, the Spurs have the flexibility to go in several different directions, as there are roster spots and potentially minutes available for a player that can separate himself as the team eventually transitions eras. Depth in the backcourt, on the wing and in the frontcourt are all areas the Spurs could point to as needs depending on some tough decisions they faced in free agency this summer, but adding star-power to a roster full of strong role-players is definitely something they will need to do eventually to win a playoff series.  Branham exploded onto the scouting scene in Big Ten play, seemingly improving every game and still possessing considerable upside at just 19 years old. Branham's combination of size, frame, 6-10 wingspan, scoring instincts and shot-making prowess off the dribble (44% FG) and with his feet set (43%) looks seamlessly translatable to what the NBA is looking for at his position. He plays with a unique combination of aggressiveness and poise for a player who just turned 19, and the fact that he made such impressive strides as the season moved on, facilitating more for others and showing competitiveness defensively one-on-one, gives him a high ceiling as a prospect. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Christian Braun",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kansas","KU",NA,NA,NA," March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Braun plays up to four positions for Kansas, switching seamlessly on the perimeter, putting a body on big men in the post and doing quite a bit of facilitation in the half-court. He's an outstanding rebounder, Kansas' best rim-protector, and is converting 38% of his 3-pointers, making him one of the more versatile wing players in this class. Somewhat of a jack of all trades, master of none, Braun's ability to emerge as a consistent scoring presence, and not run away from open jump-shots, will be scrutinized by scouts as the stakes rise in big moments. He's been somewhat streaky at times from beyond the arc, but has found more success as of late after hitting a midseason slump, while consistently doing all the little things his team needs to win games. Benefiting from the platform of a Final Four run would go a long way in solidifying his standing as a first-round pick. -- Jonathan Givony Jan. 26, 2022: (Mock Draft) -- Like his Kansas teammate Agbaji, Braun has also taken a major step forward as an upperclassman, becoming one of the most versatile wing players in college basketball and a bona fide first-round candidate. It's easy to envision Braun on an NBA floor when looking at his strong size, build and explosiveness. He's had several memorable dunks this season and ranks as the No. 1 shot-blocker in this draft class among guards and wing prospects. He's also tasked with considerable playmaking responsibility for a team that lacks great shot creation, serving as the Jayhawks' best post-entry passer and lob-thrower and showing quite a bit of creativity attacking closeouts with his head up and whipping passes off a live dribble with either hand. Defensively, Braun shows real toughness holding his ground in the paint, crashing the glass and locking up guards and wings on the perimeter in 1-on-1 situations. He's always in the right spots off the ball, fights over screens aggressively, gets in passing lanes frequently and just forced potential draft pick Terrence Shannon Jr., (Texas Tech) to one of the worst games of his college career. While fairly efficient as a scorer (61% true shooting percentage on the season), Braun's offensive struggles in Big 12 play (50% TS%) have been a bit concerning after his red-hot start. It appears he's nowhere near the 3-point shooter his freshman season (46% from 3) suggested, making just 33% of his attempts from beyond the arc in the past season-and-a-half, something that is clearly his swing skill at the NBA level. Braun's excellent free throw percentage (81% this season, 79% for career) and the general touch he shows around the basket is encouraging, but he passes up more open looks than you'd expect and doesn't have as quick a release or ability to make pullup jumpers as you might hope. Finding more consistency in this area would make Braun the type of plug-and-play all-around wing every NBA team is looking for, and how he finishes the year and performs in the pre-draft process (if he elects to declare) will be important. His competitiveness, swagger and fiery demeanor has earned him a lot of fans in NBA circles regardless, and it's likely a matter of when he'll find himself in an NBA uniform, not if. -- Jonathan Givony ","The Nuggets were able to absorb the losses of stars Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. and still compete for home-court advantage in the playoffs thanks to the presence of back-to-back MVP Nikola Jokic. With both players back in the fold, along with Aaron Gordon, a strong nucleus of talent is in place to challenge the best teams in the West. It's unclear how much this pick, and the additional late first-rounder the team acquired in a cap-clearing trade, will be able to contribute immediately on a roster with solid positional depth and versatility, but building through the draft has always been a priority for this team which has drafted well through the years.  Braun played an essential role in Kansas' national championship run, playing up to four positions while switching seamlessly on the perimeter, putting a body on big men in the post and doing quite a bit of facilitation in the half-court. He's an excellent rebounder and Kansas' best rim-protector, and he converted 39% of his 3-pointers, making him one of the more versatile wing players in this draft class. When the team needed a stop in a key late-game moment in the national championship, they turned to him to put the clamps on the much smaller Caleb Love, a sign of the trust he earned from the coaching staff -- and what makes him interesting as a plug-and-play role player for the NBA level. Braun's average ball handling and shot-creation prowess, and slow release on his jumper, limit his upside as a scorer, but he does so many little things that it's hard to see him not finding success in the NBA in some capacity. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Walker Kessler",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Auburn","AUB",NA,NA,NA,"December 22, 2021: (Mock Draft) -- Sparsely used as a freshman at North Carolina, Kessler transferred to Auburn where he has turned into one of the better bigs in college. Now paired up with potential No. 1 pick Jabari Smith, the Tigers have one of the best frontcourts in the country and are sitting pretty with a 13-1 record.  Kessler has improved throughout the year, recording the first points-rebounds-blocks triple-double against a ranked opponent in more than 15 years. Kessler finished with 16 points, 10 rebounds and 11 blocks in a win over LSU. Kessler's appeal starts with his dimensions, weighing 245 pounds with a 7-5 wingspan and a 9-3 standing reach. He towers over opponents, making him an outstanding target for pick-and-roll lobs, and shows reliable hands while catching pocket passes. He's able to knock down turnaround jumpers and hook shots while demonstrating polished footwork around the basket or attacking closeouts from the perimeter with both hands. He also shows potential with his passing, especially out of high-low and short rolls where he has mostly made good decisions while flashing a feel for cutting to open spots. Known for his shooting prowess in high school, he's just a 19.2% shooter from 3 and 56% from the free throw line in his college career. Rediscovering his stroke would be notable; there are questions about whether he has the run-jump quickness and explosiveness to emerge as a major scorer at the NBA level, as there's a bit of a robotic quality to his game in that he relies on his size to find advantages. Where NBA teams will find Kessler most appealing is on defense, where he's the No. 1 shot-blocker in the college game according to several metrics. He's agile, slides his feet laterally and has proven capable of staying in front of smaller players with quick hip turns to contain opponents without fouling and then erase shots at the rim with timing and instincts. His mobility and smarts give Auburn flexibility covering pick-and-rolls depending on the opponent's personnel, as he's proven capable of handling hard hedges, drops and switches, or downing to the baseline. Naturally right-handed, most of Kessler's blocks come with his left, as his hand-eye coordination and reaction time allow him to stay down on fakes and keep rejections in bounds, often recovering at the rim after initially appearing to get beat. Entering SEC play, which features seven top-25 teams according to the ESPN BPI, will be a major opportunity for Kessler to solidify himself as a first-round prospect. Auburn's only loss, and one of Kessler's worst games of the season, came against a physical frontcourt opponent in UConn's Adama Sanogo, which will make matchups with Kentucky, Florida, Tennessee and Alabama intriguing. With a great deal of NBA talent and a roster that looks capable of making a Final Four run, Auburn will be one of the most closely scouted teams in the country over the next three months. -- Jonathan Givony","The Timberwolves acquired this pick from the Memphis Grizzlies on draft night. The Timberwolves look like one of the NBA's most promising young teams, fresh off an encouraging season that culminated in a play-in game victory and the franchise's second playoff appearance in 18 years. Nevertheless, ownership elected to swing for the fences in acquiring one of the most respected executives in the league in Tim Connelly. Connelly will now look to surround Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns with the requisite pieces needed to take the next step in their development and attempt to win the franchise's first playoff series since the Kevin Garnett era, with defensive improvements likely being a major priority towards that goal. One significant question mark the team will need to answer short-term pertains to the impending free agency of D'Angelo Russell, a close friend of Towns, in a year from now.  At 7-1, 245 pounds, with a 7-4 wingspan, Kessler's appeal is readily evident on first glance. Named the NCAA's Defensive Player of the Year, he was the best shot-blocker in college, while showing some versatility and mobility guarding pick and roll, stepping out the perimeter and recovering to make plays at the rim. He is a steady offensive presence with his ability to catch difficult passes, hammer home lobs, finish with touch around the basket and make good decisions out of short rolls. Kessler had some issues dealing with physicality at times this year and has some limitations offensively for what NBA teams expect from a modern big man in terms of shooting range, which limits his upside to a degree, but he also has a relatively high floor that gives him good value on a rookie-scale contract. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","David Roddy",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Colorado State","CSU",NA,NA,NA,"May 24, 2022: (Winners and losers of the 2022 NBA draft combine) -- Touted as a potential first-round sleeper at different points of his junior season, Roddy was unable to back that up in two 5-on-5 games, averaging just 5 points, 3 rebounds and 1 assist per game while missing all six of his 3-point attempts. Roddy still had a positive impact on the game by sliding up and checking bigs on some possessions, attacking off the catch and making heady reads in the half court. But as Roddy struggled to knock down 3s, he started to turn down open looks and had issues finishing around the rim versus length (5-for-11 from 2). While energetic on defense with strong athletic testing numbers, he proved he's much more effective in small spaces on that end than he is covering ground given his 261-pound frame. It shouldn't come as a huge surprise that Roddy had his ups and downs given the adjustment from the Mountain West Conference. In spite of those issues, Roddy was able to really shine in his pro day, showcasing his underrated leaping ability and shooting touch. He still has fans in NBA circles given his strength, agility and versatility, and will benefit from the success of players like Grant Williams in the NBA playoffs. But Roddy was unable to use the combine platform to emerge as a legitimate first-round candidate like I expected he might. -- Mike Schmitz March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- The Mountain West Conference player of the year, Roddy emerged as a potential All-American and one of the most versatile and unique college players as a junior. At 6-foot-6, he sees quite a few minutes at center, which he can thrive at thanks to his 260-pound frame. While he's comfortable operating with his back to the basket, he's also a creative ball-handler and outstanding passer who is converting 45% of his 3-pointers on the season, making him a huge mismatch that has lit up mid-major and high-major teams alike. While Roddy is competitive with excellent instincts, his lateral quickness and ultimate position defensively at the NBA level is something scouts will want to gather more information about in the NCAA tournament. He has a great opportunity to solidify his standing versus a Big Ten team in Michigan and then a potential showdown with Tennessee, one of the best defensive teams in college basketball in the Round of 32. -- Jonathan Givony Feb. 14, 2022: Although you can't miss his 6-6, 260-pound frame, 20-year-old junior David Roddy has been hiding out in the Mountain West Conference and hasn't quite received the type of NBA buzz you'd expect given his productivity and efficiency on a 19-3 Colorado State team. Roddy is no mystery prospect among true college basketball die-hards, as he's a three-year starter as the leader of a strong Rams program. Yet given his thick frame that resembles a late-career Charles Barkley along with his unique skill set for his body type, he's a prospect NBA front offices are bound to be divided on and confused by. You don't see many 260-pounders who move like he does with his skill set, which is likely to lead to questions like: Who does he guard? What position is he? Can he maintain his conditioning? Will his production translate? Diving into his film and watching him live in Reno against Nevada, his combination of shooting touch, ball handling, vision, competitiveness, and agility really stood out, looking to me like a true first-round caliber prospect as a small-ball 4/5. Simply put, Roddy is a basketball player, and a really good one at that. Just eight players since 2000 have averaged at least 19 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 steal and 1 block like Roddy is this season, and only three have ever reached those marks with a true shooting percentage over 65% -- Grant Williams (2019), Larry Johnson (1991) and Roddy. While 25% of his offense comes out of the post, most of his game is translatable, as the Rams use him somewhat like Duke uses Paolo Banchero, giving him freedom to create in transition, as a pick-and-roll ball handler, and out of the mid-post. After making just 20% of his 3s as a freshman and 29% as a sophomore, Roddy now ranks in the top-10 in jump shot efficiency as a junior and is drilling 47% of his triples on 74 attempts. He can even toss in stepback 3s or mid-post turnarounds on occasion. He's a sturdy ball handler, an impressive off-the-dribble passer, ultra-competitive and an underrated leaper - he held several football scholarships to play quarterback and was also a track and field standout. Scouts will surely debate who he defends with his body type and perceived lack of foot speed, even with a 7-0 wingspan at his disposal and the frame to battle some 5s on the interior. But having watched Roddy both in shootaround and during live action, he's intense, vocal, and understands the scouting report with the type of approach to help him maximize his potential defensively. Scouts would be wise to think outside the box with the oversized yet vertically-challenged Roddy and get past his thick frame and the level of competition. On his best nights, he looks like a cross between Grant Williams and Talen Horton-Tucker, which is more than worthy of a 1st round selection. Roddy is one of the mid-major prospects teams we will be following closely through the NCAA tournament, hoping to see him against a high-ranking prospect or stout defense to better gauge how his game will translate to the NBA.  -- Mike Schmitz ","According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the 76ers traded the No. 23 pick to the Grizzlies for De'Anthony Melton.  The Mountain West Conference Player of the Year, Roddy emerged as an All-American and one of the most versatile and unique players in the college game as a junior. At 6-6, he sees quite a few minutes at center, which he can thrive at thanks to his 260-pound frame. While he's comfortable operating with his back to the basket, he's also a creative ball handler and outstanding passer who converted 44% of his 3-pointers, making him a huge mismatch that has lit up mid-major and high-major teams alike.

"ESPN","MarJon Beauchamp",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"G League Ignite","G League Ignite",NA,NA,NA,"December 22, 2021: (Mock draft) -- With high-level NBA decision-makers sitting courtside at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center to watch the G League Ignite on Sunday, Beauchamp was arguably the best player on the floor, looking the part of a potential lottery pick in the process. The 20-year-old, long-armed wing finished with 21 points on 14 shots, 4 rebounds, 5 assists and 2 steals against Grand Rapids, playing with nonstop energy on both ends of the floor while defending former NBA vets, including 12-year pro Lance Stephenson. Beauchamp's value was further accentuated when he was ruled out due to illness as the Ignite were trounced by the Austin Spurs.  After spending two days around the Ignite in October, I wrote that Beauchamp, ""could go down as the G League Ignite's biggest success story to date."" That proclamation is still holding through 12 games as he's gone from basketball nomad to surefire first-round pick in a matter of six months, averaging 15.1 points, 7.3 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 1.5 steals in 36 minutes. When I first evaluated Beauchamp at a Rainier Beach open gym in Seattle more than three years ago, he was a jumbo point guard with talent off the dribble but minimal defensive intensity. That reputation carried him to four different high schools and a stint at Yakima Valley Community College. ""I had to go through a lot of stuff and find my game,"" he told ESPN's Jonathan Givony after his big game on Sunday. ""Really just bring that energy because I used to play lackadaisical. I just feel like I changed on that side and my defense, I locked in on that a lot more than I used to."" Beauchamp will still get caught ball watching or help off of a strong side corner shooter. But at 6-6 with a 7-1 wingspan, huge hands and a newfound motor, he projects as a multi-position defender in the NBA with the potential to impact the game like Mikal Bridges or Matisse Thybulle. He has excellent feet, works hard to contest jumpers, competes on three-quarter denials in the post and is rangy enough to contest for steals and blocks from the weakside. He's also an excellent positional rebounder. The best part of Beauchamp's projection is that you don't have to run plays for him to make his presence felt, which bodes well for his NBA future. He's a gap-filler wing who generates offense without using any dribbles by being opportunistic in transition, finding soft spots as a cutter and getting downhill off pindowns and closeout attacks. He's also an above average passer, showing the ability to make simple drop-offs and kick outs, especially in transition. His experience functioning as a big guard in those Seattle open runs is now more useful, thus giving him more upside than defensive-minded wings. To reach his full potential, he'll have to improve as a 3-point shooter, as he's a bit hesitant to fire off the catch, even from the corners. But he boasts strong shooting mechanics and flashes a reliable stroke in the midrange and from the charity stripe. -- Mike Schmitz October 29, 2021: (G League Ignite preview) -- If his play in Walnut Creek so far is any indication, Beauchamp could go down as the G League Ignite's biggest success story to date. Where the Ignite can truly have an impact is with talented prospects in dire need of direction and development. Enter Beauchamp, whose winding road could have ended in an obscure country on a low-level team 10 years ago. Beauchamp -- born in Yakima, Washington -- played for four different high schools in four years before ultimately signing with unproven training program Chameleon BX in the Bay Area. Beauchamp landed at Yakima Valley Junior College, where he put up huge numbers and received collegiate interest, but questions loomed about his NCAA eligibility. If it weren't for the alternate pathways that now exist, the 20-year-old might have played at a low level abroad and never truly addressed some bad habits on the court.  With NBA scouts now able to evaluate him in a competitive setting, Beauchamp has opened eyes, looking the part of a potential first-rounder at times. He's the most physically impressive of the Ignite prospects at 6-6 with a wide-shouldered 194-pound frame and a 7-1 wingspan, comparing favorably to NBA wings such as Kelly Oubre Jr., Matisse Thybulle and Mikal Bridges. More of a creator when we first evaluated him in 2018, Beauchamp is playing a 3 and D wing role for Hart, showing the ability to defend multiple positions, make plays off the ball with his length, attack gaps offensively, knock down spot 3s and even create for his teammates in spurts. With the NBA starved for wing defenders in Beauchamp's mold, he doesn't have to be prolific this season to garner real first-round interest. If he can defend with energy, shoot around 35% from distance, and prove to be a sound decision-maker, Beauchamp could emerge as the Ignite's second-best draft-eligible prospect.  -- Mike Schmitz ","After Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks to their first NBA championship in 40 years last year, the team took a step back this season and bowed out to Boston in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. With their core of Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton intact, the Bucks will be back among the NBA's best teams next season but have work to do in filling out the roster and ensuring the team has enough depth and perimeter shooting to compete in the competitive Eastern Conference. Brook Lopez's injury-plagued season and Bobby Portis' impending free agency after a breakout year require immediate attention, but there are several areas of need on the roster in the backcourt and on the wing, as well.  Beauchamp is the poster child of what G League Ignite can offer as a platform, going from completely off the NBA radar after a nomadic high school career and a junior college stint to first-round pick in the span of eight months. Beauchamp has ideal physical tools for a wing, measuring over 6-6 with a near 7-1 wingspan, allowing him to defend anywhere from point guards to power forwards thanks to his excellent lateral quickness and the strong intensity he displays. He doesn't need plays called for him to find his offense, doing most of his scoring by running the floor in transition, cutting off the ball, crashing the glass and getting downhill off handoffs and attacking closeouts. Beauchamp's ball handling and perimeter shooting will need to continue to improve to carve out a significant role, but he's on an excellent trajectory and seems to have more potential to grow into than his age might suggest. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Blake Wesley",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Notre Dame","ND",NA,NA,NA," March 21, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Where they rank after the first weekend of the NCAA tournament) -- Notre Dame's surprise NCAA tournament run came to an end as the No. 1 defense in college basketball, Texas Tech, held potential first-round pick Wesley to just 3-for-14 shooting in 32 minutes, putting an end to a freshman campaign that featured everything from remarkable highlights to head-scratching lows. Wesley shot 13-for-37 from 2 and 0-for-8 from 3 against Rutgers, Alabama and the Red Raiders while committing more turnovers than assists. While he tried to relentlessly attack Texas Tech with downhill attacks, Wesley ran out of gas, showing where he has the most room to improve in the process.  Despite the inefficiency, Wesley's talent still popped, particularly in Notre Dame's win over Alabama (18 points on 14 shots), where he looked like the best prospect on the floor. He has NBA-caliber burst off the bounce, proved comfortable rising up in mid-range spots. He's looked far more competitive defensively as the year has gone on, using that quickness, length and solid instincts to add value both on and off the ball, making plays in the passing lanes, blowing up handoffs and proving more than capable containing the ball in 1-on-1 situations. But the game still moves too quickly for the 19-year-old -- Wesley committed several costly turnovers in the last five minutes of Sunday's loss. He's still searching for the right blend between scoring and playmaking, as he regularly missed kick outs or drop offs once he got a piece of the paint. Among the 143 players to take at least 130 shots at the rim in the half court, Wesley ranks 142nd in efficiency. He will also have to prove himself as a perimeter shooter throughout the pre-draft process, as he finished the year at 30.3% from 3. Wesley is a big-time talent who has NBA feet and shift off the dribble, can get a piece of the paint at will and has at least shown enough off the dribble shooting potential to suggest there's room to improve. With a strong pre-draft process, it's not out of the question that Wesley gets looks throughout the teens, especially if he shoots the ball well. But for those who were skeptical about his NBA readiness and consistent impact, Wesley's showing against Texas Tech didn't do anything to ease those concerns. -- Mike Schmitz March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Wesley is a dynamic shot-creating guard who burst onto the scene as a surprise one-and-done and has piqued the interest of NBA scouts with his ability to go get a bucket off the dribble like few guards, sharing some similarities to a guard such as James Bouknight at the same stage. Standing 6-foot-5 with long arms and excellent footwork as a ball handler, Wesley has a lot of juice off the bounce, changing speeds and directions to attack the rim or stop on a dime to pull up. Although talented with the ball both as a scorer and occasional distributor, the game is still slowing down for Wesley, who can be a bit wild as a decision-maker, which shows in his inefficiency from 3 (31%) and struggles around the rim (42% in the half court). Proving that he values every defensive possession will be key for Wesley in NCAA tournament play, also. Scouts will want to see if he can turn that talent into consistent and efficient production - on both ends -- in do-or-die games that matter before anointing him a surefire first-round pick. -- Mike Schmitz January 21, 2022: (2023 Mock Draft) -- Notre Dame guard Blake Wesley has been a hot name in scouting circles over the past couple of months thanks to his dynamic scoring ability, positional length and glimpses of playmaking as Notre Dame's most talented shot creator. Averaging 17.6 points in 33.3 minutes over his past five games, the 6-foot-5 18-year-old has shown enough to garner real interest throughout the first round, but he is in no rush to simply be a late-first-round pick, according to sources we've spoken to, and likely has the most potential in the country to be next year's Ivey. Becoming a more consistent shooter, defender and full-time point guard could certainly make Wesley a top-10 selection in 2023 and one of the most exciting guards in the nation.  -- Mike Schmitz","With the third and final first-round pick -- acquired in a trade with the Boston Celtics for Derrick White at last season's trade deadline -- the Spurs continued to add young talent to their roster.  Wesley has strong physical tools for a guard with a 6-9 wingspan, an excellent frame, a quick first step and long strides slashing through the lane. He was able to emerge from no-name high school recruit to NBA prospect very quickly thanks to the potential he showed as a shot-creator at Notre Dame, where he was surrounded by plenty of shooting and experience, and made real strides on the defensive end as well, giving him significant potential to grow into at just 19 years old. The evolution of Wesley's perimeter shooting, passing and overall decision-making will help determine what type of career he has ultimately, but there's quite a bit to work with here from a pure talent perspective. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Wendell Moore Jr",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Duke","DUKE","Moore checks quite a few boxes NBA teams look for at the small forward position. He has ideal size at 6-foot-6 in shoes with a huge 7-foot wingspan and a strong 213 pound frame. He's making 40% of his 3-pointers on the season and is a career 80% free throw shooter in 94 games in our database. He's Duke's best passer statistically, leading the team with his 4.6 assists per game, and often tasked with initiating the team's offense, making post-entry passes and serving as the designated inbounder. He's a multi-positional defender as well, typically asked to guard the opposing team's best perimeter player, whether that's a point guard or wing. In years past he saw quite a few minutes guarding power forwards as well, although the make-up of this year's roster doesn't require that.  Even though Moore has been a starter for the better part of three years, he's only two months older than Kentucky freshman TyTy Washington Jr., and is younger than many of the sophomores projected to be drafted. That's what makes the significant jump he made from his underwhelming first two seasons at Duke to his current All-ACC campaign intriguing -- he clearly has more upside to tap into than most juniors, and already has a pretty high floor as a prospect thanks to his defense and passing ability, while playing a position of huge need.  ","While Moore ticks virtually every box NBA teams look for as a 3-and-D wing, he's still at times a better prospect in theory than in reality, prone to disappearing and making head-scratching plays on both ends of the floor, especially in high-leverage moments. Passivity has been an issue for Moore in his career, but he can also be something of a jack-of-all-trades, master of none, making scouts question what he can truly hang his hat on to carve out minutes for himself early in his NBA career.  Offense can be tough to come by for Moore at times, as he's an average ball-handler who lacks a degree of explosiveness as a finisher. His excellent shooting percentages don't tell the full story of his true scoring ability, as he passes up more open shots than you'd hope and doesn't shoot the ball the same way every time, especially off the dribble where opponents regularly go under ball-screens and generally don't guard him like someone they truly fear as a jump-shooter. Defensively, he doesn't always bring the level of physicality and intensity you might hope, having more lapses off the ball than you might hope for in a player with as much experience as he does.  Comps at the next level (ceiling/floor) There's no shortage of high-level NBA wing players with similar physical dimensions as Moore (height/weight/wingspan), which is where teams often start their comparison-hunting. Many such players, including Dorian Finney-Smith, Andre Iguodala, Thaddeus Young, Keldon Johnson, Cody Martin and Nassir Little have seen significant minutes at the power forward position in the NBA, which Moore might lack a degree of physicality to do. If he can develop in that department as his career moves forward, it is difficult to see him completely failing, as switchable wings who can make an open shot and keep the ball moving offensively are extremely valuable these days. Moore can look toward versatile wing such as Shake Milton, who also was a prolific passer in college, and hope to replicate some of his success. Romeo Langford, Theo Pinson and Josh Green are some other less successful players that come to mind.  Optimal/practical NBA team fits: The NBA is so starved for depth at the wing position that it would be easier to point to teams that don't need a player in Moore's mold than teams that do. Any of the playoff teams picking in the late first round, for example the Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls, Denver Nuggets or Milwaukee Bucks. There's a deep class of wing prospects vying for those spots in the late first and early second rounds, but also quite a bit of demand. A strong finish to the season would position Moore well in that crop.  -- Jonathan Givony ",NA,"March 28, 2022: (Final Four week mock draft) -- Moore played an important role in Duke's Elite Eight victory over Arkansas, providing timely shot-creation and defensive versatility while bringing an aggressive mindset on both ends of the floor, something he has done consistently all season. Too happy to fade into the background in his first two seasons at Duke, especially in key moments, Moore's willingness to stay in attack mode all game both in transition and the half court was a welcome sight. While he was more of a mixed bag in the Sweet 16 against Texas Tech, especially defensively, Moore still did his part to step up down the stretch and make key plays to help his team advance. As the most veteran member of Duke's rotation, his experience will be essential in its quest of winning a national championship next weekend. -- Jonathan Givony  March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Duke's most versatile prospect, Moore is an X factor of sorts for the Blue Devils as he gives them a different dimension when he's fully engaged and playing with confidence as a do-it-all wing who can initiate offense, make open 3s, attack the rim and defend his position. Only two players in the country average at least 13 points, five rebounds and four assists while shooting at least 50% from 2 and 40% from 3 -- Moore and Baylor Scheierman of South Dakota State. At 6-foot-6 with a strong frame and a 7-foot wingspan, in theory, Moore is the exact type of versatile wing the NBA covets. However, he toggles between brilliant moments and head-scratching ones, not always quite as consistently aggressive as you'd hope in big moments given his experience. Scouts will be closely analyzing whether or not Moore takes a back seat in important moments or takes ownership as one of the lone upperclassmen during a Blue Devils NCAA tournament run. How scouts feel about his confidence and aggression will go a long way in determining whether NBA teams view him as the next productive college upperclassmen turned draft-day steal a la Herb Jones and Ayo Dosunmu. -- Mike Schmitz February 25, 2022: (Projecting Duke players) -- ","According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Timberwolves acquired the No. 26 pick from the Rockets for the No. 29 pick and two future second-round picks.    Moore ticks quite a few boxes NBA teams look for at small forward. He has ideal size at 6-5 1/2 in shoes with a 7-0 1/2 wingspan and a strong 217-pound frame. He's made 41% of his 3-pointers last season and is a career 81% free throw shooter. He was Duke's best passer statistically, leading the team with his 4.4 assists per game, and was often tasked with initiating the team's offense, making post-entry passes and being their designated in-bounder.  He's a multi-positional defender, typically asked to guard the opposing team's best perimeter player, whether that's a point guard or wing, but also saw time checking power forwards earlier in his career as well. While possessing significant experience with more than 2,500 college minutes, he still has more upside to tap into than most juniors at 20 years old, and already has a pretty high floor as a prospect thanks to his defense and passing ability. Moore's strong showings on the private workout circuit helped solidify him as a first-round pick despite some question marks he endured about just how he scores in the NBA, and his level of aggressiveness and physicality, which sometimes waned. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Nikola  Jovic",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mega Mozzart","Mega Mozzart",NA,NA,NA,"January 26, 2022: (Mock Draft) -- Although this international class doesn't have an elite passer (Josh Giddey) or a low-post savant (Alperen Sengun), there are still several prospects bound to develop into productive NBA players. None of them intrigue me quite like Serbian forward Nikola Jovic (No. 22 in Givony's latest mock), who has as good a chance as any to be the first international prospect to hear his name called on draft night. Due to COVID-19 cancellations in the Adriatic League, we weren't able to see Jovic play in a game like originally planned for Mega Mozzart in Serbia. But we did see him practice with the team and conducted a 30-minute film session with the 18-year-old after diving deep into his game tape, continuing to build our scouting file on him that began in 2019. Of all the international prospects in this draft, Jovic has the most seamless NBA fit as a modern forward who can shoot, handle and pass. Every bit of 6-10 with an improved 215-pound frame and a 7-0 wingspan, Jovic's measurements are similar to forwards ranging from Michael Porter Jr. to Kevin Knox to Sam Dekker to Darius Bazley. With the size to function as a four once his body matures, the late-blooming Jovic looks the part of a legitimate NBA floor-spacer with the shooting stroke to back it up, as he's now up to 40% from the international line through 14 games, often earning comparisons to Nemanja Bjelica (drafted No. 35 in 2010) in the process.  But what makes Jovic a bit more intriguing than your typical catch-and-shoot forward is the potential he shows off the dribble, regularly bringing the ball up the floor for Mega Mozzart, displaying sharp pick-and-roll vision going to his right while also knocking down several deep hesitation pull-up 3s with bigs switched onto him. His high center of gravity with the ball and finishing struggles in traffic (46% at the rim) limit him as a primary shot creator. And teams have also found quite a bit of success just defending him with small guards and daring him to punish that mismatch on the low block, which he hasn't done with much success. But because Jovic can make hesitation and step-back 3s, find his teammates on the move when willing and occasionally drop in Dirk-like fallaways from inside the arc, it's not out of the question that, in time, he can eventually evolve into a Danilo Gallinari-style second or third creator who can function as a big wing or a mismatch four. To earn those reps, Jovic will have to improve drastically on defense, as he's a bit too upright to consistently stay with perimeter players yet not quite physical enough to bang with true bigs on the interior. Evolving his off-ball defense and stabilizing his often-fluctuating motor will really help him win the margins, as he's likely never going to quite have the range or flexibility to be a 1-on-1 stopper. He has shown signs of growth lately, bodying up forwards like Rodions Kurucs on penetration and using his positional length to change shots in the paint. After a slow start to the season, Jovic has turned into a valuable player for Mega, scoring 14 points and dishing out 4 assists in just 22 minutes in a huge upset win over Partizan, showcasing character and fight in the road win with a much younger, undermanned team. Although he was off for a month due to COVID and an ankle injury, Jovic has now reached double figures scoring in each of his last six games. He's made at least two 3s in eight consecutive contests, shooting 18-for-42 from 3 (43%) during that stretch. Displaying outright horrible body language at times during the U19 World Championships last summer and not always managing his emotions in the best way in other events, the 18-year-old Jovic is starting to show more signs of maturity both in his game and demeanor, which will play a big role in the type of NBA player he can become. ""I want to be consistent through the second half of the season,"" Jovic said of his goals for the season, and five years down the line. ""The thing I'm trying to accomplish is go to the NBA ... stretch-4 with a lot of dribbling. I don't know, we'll see, I hope All-Star."" -- Mike Schmitz ","Miami is coming off an overwhelmingly positive season, finishing with the No. 1 seed in the East and falling one game short of the NBA Finals in a narrow Game 7 loss to the Celtics. With most of their core intact next season, the Heat will continue to navigate salary cap and luxury tax restraints while trying to add value along the margins -- something they've done more successfully than any team in the NBA over the past few years, thanks to their outstanding scouting, player development and coaching staff. Tyler Herro's extension eligibility, Victor Oladipo's free agency, and Kyle Lowry's age and declining playoff performance are the main issues the front office will evaluate in the offseason. Whether to explore a trade for Duncan Robinson, one of the team's highest-paid players who fell out of the playoff rotation, is another important decision. Considering the relatively solid depth the team has developed throughout the roster, the Heat were in a position to draft any type of player they want with their late first-round pick, giving them good flexibility.  Jovic has impressive dimensions for a player who spent much of the season at the small forward position -- measuring 6-11 in shoes with a nine-and-a-half-foot standing reach that might allow him to see some minutes at center as his frame fills out long-term. He's a skilled, versatile offensive player who shows strong passing ability and flashes of dynamic shot-making and shot-creation prowess, as well as unbridled confidence. Jovic grappled with poor scoring efficiency this season, has major question marks to answer defensively, and allegedly struggled in private workouts ahead of the draft -- something that caused his stock to drop somewhat on draft night. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Patrick Baldwin Jr",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Milwaukee","MILW",NA,NA,NA,"February 22, 2022: (Mock Draft and Top 100 update) -- The last time we checked in on Patrick Baldwin in late December, he was coming off a challenging stretch of non-conference action, with poor showings against the likes of Florida, Colorado and Rhode Island, the best teams Milwaukee will face this season. Since then, things have gone from bad to worse, as he's missed significant time with a troublesome ankle injury and COVID-19, while continuing to struggle in Horizon League action, shooting just 28% from the field with more than twice as many turnovers as assists since the start of the calendar year. His team has been statistically better with him off the floor than on it, as they haven't won a game in league play with him in the starting lineup, while going 6-4 without him, a troubling development for a player thought to be a significant difference maker at the mid-major level and once a projected top-10 pick when the season started.  NBA teams privately sound extremely concerned about Baldwin's left ankle, which caused him to miss most of his high school senior year and is clearly not 100% based on the amount of time he's missed and the fact that he's been essentially day-to-day for the past two months. Even when healthy, watching him has been a largely miserable experience, as he's mostly settled for incredibly high degree of difficulty shots, played lackluster defense, had significant problems generating good looks for himself or others against low-level competition, and has shown a concerning lack of toughness and feel for the game, all of which is concerning to say the least. While being a top-10 pick is now likely off the table, Baldwin's status as a sure-fire first-rounder is far from certain due to his poor play, especially if his ankle doesn't receive a long-term clean bill of health from NBA doctors. Comparable players in terms of style of play, such as Jabari Parker, aren't as en vogue in today's NBA as in the past, as teams have largely gone away from these types of inefficient scorers who don't defend with toughness or make others better. Baldwin has one last chance to salvage his season when the Horizon League championship starts at the beginning of March, if he even is able to suit up. Milwaukee will need to win four games to make the NCAA tournament, a tall task to say the least, but scouts will want to see if Baldwin can at least show more urgency than the extreme level of apathy he's mostly displayed thus far. Baldwin will likely look better in the pre-draft process, where teams will see a 6-10, strong-framed, dynamic shot-maker who is still only 19 years old in individual workouts and wonder just how far a talented prospect like this should fall before he's worth rolling the dice on. Baldwin will likely come prepared with a long list of mitigating circumstances to explain away his disastrous season, but the damage he's caused his draft stock thus far may be hard to reverse at this point.  - Jonathan Givony December 22, 2021: (Mock Draft) -- With 33 scouts gathered in Boulder, Colorado, to evaluate Baldwin against the Colorado Buffaloes in one of his biggest tests of the season, the 19-year-old was unable to rise to the occasion. Baldwin finished with just 12 points on 13 shots, while struggling defensively and crumbling down the stretch of a competitive game, leading to skepticism amongst NBA evaluators.  Watching Baldwin go through skill drills at shootaround, his talent popped. With a 7-2 wingspan, big hands and an smooth shooting stroke, he looks the part of a plug-and-play NBA starter in a 1-on-0 setting. With almost every seat occupied with NBA personnel during his pregame routine, we all marveled at his handle and footwork. But when the game tipped, Baldwin looked rattled and gassed during his 31 minutes on the floor. He hoisted multiple air balls, gave up several offensive rebounds and got beat off the dribble by Colorado wing and fellow NBA prospect Jabari Walker. Moreover, Baldwin had issues playing through contact, didn't bring much energy or emotion to the floor and struggled to find the right balance between knowing when to move the ball and when to be assertive. Baldwin followed up the Colorado game with another dud against Rhode Island, scoring six points on eight shots in a 24-point loss, his last chance to show out against a well-respected, nonconference opponent this season. In four games against teams with a winning record, Baldwin averaged 9.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 26.5 minutes on 35% shooting from 2 and 21% from 3. In four games against teams with a .500 record or worse, Baldwin averaged 18.5 points, 6.8 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 29.8 minutes while shooting 41% from 2 and 44% from 3. Those splits support Baldwin as a polarizing prospect for NBA scouts. His combination of size, on-the-move shooting, ballhandling and passing ability has a place in today's NBA as a potential starter. He's never going to be asked to create the majority of his team's offense like he is at Milwaukee, which should mask some of his shortcomings in getting by defenders and ability to be aggressive with the ball. He's also been nursing an ankle injury which could be contributing to his uneven season. Baldwin has never quite made as many shots as his silky shooting stroke suggests -- 33% from 3 on 46 attempts. Baldwin's incredibly quiet on the floor and plays with a nervous energy, making many wonder whether he can make enough shots in key moments at the next level. His defensive shortcomings are also a hurdle to early NBA playing time. With conference play looming, Baldwin has enough time to get it right. But if his struggles continue against Horizon League competition, it will become difficult to justify his status as a top-10 pick. -- Mike Schmitz July 14, 2021: (FIBA Under-19 World Cup) -- Playing in his first extended action since suffering a serious ankle injury in December 2020, Baldwin looked to be shaking off the rust of the past seven months and wasn't asked to play an outsized role for this team.  Baldwin did show glimpses of what makes him interesting as a fluid 6-10 power forward who can pass off a live dribble, step into open 3-pointers and make plays defensively off the ball using his instincts and knowledge. Still, scouts in attendance say they wanted to see a bit more from the projected top-10 pick, expressing surprise at an ordinary level of explosiveness, as well as the lack of consistency he displayed as a shooter outside of wide-open 3-pointers (9-of-28 from 3, 32%) and the fact that he didn't bring the type of physicality and aggressiveness they hoped for on both ends of the floor. Many were unaware of Baldwin's recent extended absence, which clearly played a part in his struggles, as did the minor role he played on this team. Baldwin will be handed the keys to his father Pat's Milwaukee team in the Horizon League this season and have every opportunity to show that he's a different player than the one scouts saw in Riga.  -- Jonathan Givony October 14, 2019: (2021 mock draft) -- Noted early on as the potential No. 1 prospect in the class, Baldwin doesn't appear to possess the same upside as some of his peers. However, he still has plenty of gifts that will undoubtedly make him an excellent college player and eventual a high NBA draft pick. He towers over opponents, allowing him to see plenty of time as a stretch-5. He's extremely skilled for a player his age, as he's a high-level shooter who rarely misses when left open. Capable of handling in the open floor, passing on the move and making plays defensively, Baldwin is far from a one-dimensional player. He's certainly lacking a degree of high-level agility, quickness and explosiveness, and he doesn't have the most athletic body type. Baldwin did a nice job of playing with energy over the weekend and certainly has a promising future, even if there are questions about how much these skills will translate to the highest levels.  -- Mike Schmitz","With four championship rings in the past eight years, most of its core under contract next year, and a bevy of young talent waiting in the wings with three recent lottery picks in James Wiseman, Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody, the Warriors are in an envious situation entering next season, especially since it's ownership has proven willing to spend big dollars to keep the party rolling. Steph Curry is aging like a fine wine, Klay Thompson will likely continue to look like his old self the further removed he is from his disastrous injuries, and there's no reason to believe the likes of Jordan Poole, Kevon Looney, Gary Payton II and others can't be retained long-term considering everything the team has going for it. With that in mind, some may view this draft pick as icing on the cake, but the Warriors front office has proven to be fairly shrewd with the way it uses draft capital, as their roster's core was selected and developed in-house, and continuing to stockpile affordable talent has to be a priority considering the team's luxury tax situation.   Baldwin has tremendous size for a wing, measuring over 6-foot-10 with a near 7-2 wingspan and 231-pound frame. He sports an effortless stroke with a silky touch, polished footwork, the ability to make difficult shots off the dribble, a great pedigree and is just 19 years old. As talented as Baldwin is, he had an unproductive and inefficient season playing at an extremely low level of competition, where he was clearly hampered by a nagging ankle injury that dates back to his high school years. NBA scouts question his toughness on the defensive end, as well as his explosiveness and inability to make teammates better as Milwaukee clearly played better when he was out of the rotation. Those question marks caused Baldwin to fall from a projected top-10 pick to the No. 28 pick of the draft.-- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","TyTy Washington Jr",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kentucky","UK",NA,NA,NA," March 21, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Where they rank after first weekend of the NCAA tournament) -- Kentucky suffered one of the most shocking NCAA tournament upsets in recent memory, losing to No. 15 seed Saint Peter's, with their highly regarded freshman Washington having his worst game of the season at the most inopportune time possible, scoring five points on 2-for-10 shooting with more turnovers than assists, and several poor defensive possessions.  Washington simply hasn't been the same player since suffering an ankle injury two months ago in a loss at Auburn, seeing his scoring production and efficiency fall off. How healthy he was the past two months and what caused this precipitous drop in production will be a major point of conversation for lottery teams the next three months. Watching the ease in which Kentucky's entire offense was grinded to a halt by a MAAC team with a simple, but highly effective game plan will raise many of the same questions NBA teams have asked about other John Calipari guards in the past. Tyrese Maxey, Devin Booker, Tyler Herro, Keldon Johnson, Hamidou Diallo, Immanuel Quickley, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Brandon Boston Jr. and others all ended up being under-drafted after looking vastly more comfortable in the NBA than they did in college, which has caused scouts to openly discuss grading future Kentucky prospects on a curve, operating under the assumption that they simply won't be used to their full potential in college. Were Washington's weaknesses similarly accentuated by the extreme lack of shooting and spacing surrounding him? And will being placed in a more modern offensive system not built around post-ups, offensive rebounds and mid-range jumpers help solve some of the issues he faced this season with his struggles beating opponents off the dribble and finishing in traffic? Outside of one week in which Sahvir Wheeler was injured (where Washington broke John Wall and Kentucky's single-game record with 17 assists), we never quite got to see what Washington would look like as a full-time point guard, something NBA teams would surely like to know more about. Washington's ability to make reads out of ball-screens is arguably his biggest strength, but he averaged less than six pick and rolls per game, ranked 467th among division one players, per Synergy Sports Technology. Prior to Washington's injuries, he was the most efficient pick and roll player in college basketball, but he fell off the past two months. Excuses aside, it's safe to say Washington should have done better with the opportunities he had, especially with his team's season on the brink against an overmatched opponent, and certainly on the defensive end where he actually had some nice progress relative to where he started. He'll now move onto the pre-draft process, where several polarizing guard prospects, including himself, will attempt to position themselves for consideration in the No. 10 to No. 20 portion of the draft. -- Jonathan Givony March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Washington is a highly skilled 6-foot-4 guard with the type of winning pedigree that bodes well for March. Those who followed him closely through high school have long raved about his competitiveness and winning spirit, which despite nagging injuries did shine through at times during his freshman campaign. Washington plays a relatively simple game, thriving off transition hit-aheads, spot 3s, closeout attacks, midrange pull-ups, floaters and occasional ball screens, for which he makes the right play more often than not. While Washington isn't the most dynamic player or overly shifty ball handler, scouts will be studying his ball skills and ability to break down his man, as he has been far more efficient and effective against lesser teams, boasting a 50.5 true shooting percentage (TS%) in 21 games against teams with a winning record versus a 61.5 TS% in nine games against teams under .500. NBA teams also will keep a close eye on his defense, which has been up and down. A head-to-head matchup with Ivey in the Sweet 16 would be a great chance for Washington to prove that his more methodical game can hold up against a high-level athlete. -- Mike Schmitz January 26, 2022: (Mock Draft) -- Washington has hit his stride in a major way after a slow start, making a case for not only SEC freshman of the year consideration, but also potentially conference player of the year honors. He broke John Wall's single-game assist record at Kentucky by dishing out 17 assists against Georgia on Jan. 8, and had his best game of the season in a blowout win over Tennessee last week, posting 28 points on just 13 shots to go along with 5 assists and 3 steals. An unfortunately timed sprained ankle caused him to exit midway through the first half of Kentucky's eventual loss at Auburn, but is not expected to keep Washington out of the lineup for long. Coming off a disappointing year in which Kentucky registered the worst offensive efficiency of John Calipari's head coaching career, the Wildcats have rebounded in a major way to rank among the very best offenses in college basketball. Washington has quite a bit to do with that, not only due to how efficiently he scores but also the poise he shows running a team and creating easy looks for teammates.  A 40% 3-point shooter, Washington has one of the best in-between games in the country, ranking No. 1 among high-major players in accuracy for runners and floaters (59%) according to Synergy Sports Technology, and top-five in pull-up jumpers (46%). While not possessing blow-by speed, Washington gets to his spots thanks to strong ball-handling skills and an ability to change pace skillfully, decelerate in the lane and use his size and strong frame to create space, while never looking sped-up. Washington's passing has equally stood out, particularly operating out of pick-and-roll, where he again ranks as the most efficient player in college basketball, per Synergy. He uses both sides of the floor, finds secondary cutters along the baseline and is just as adept at throwing lobs over the top as he is hitting the roller in stride with well-timed pocket passes, or the pop-man over the shoulder for an open jumper. Few players in the college game play with the pace he does, and the way he simplifies the game and takes what defenders give him is rare for a freshman and gives him a high floor as an NBA guard. Washington's defense, once considered a major weakness, is starting to come around too. What makes him special offensively -- how relaxed and calm he is -- tended to work against him on the other end, where his intensity level often left something to be desired, particularly off the ball. He is increasingly showing terrific instincts digging down for steals, is doing a better job getting over screens and recovering to get back in plays and is learning to use his size and frame more effectively to make things difficult on opponents, something that will likely continue to evolve moving forward. Washington's outstanding play has moved him firmly into our top 10 and gives him a chance to be the first guard picked on draft night after Jaden Ivey. NBA scouts say they still have some question marks about just how much star power he has to offer and what the extent of his long-term upside is due to his age (20, older than sophomores Ivey and Johnny Davis) and average explosiveness, but his game and especially his size and versatility as a passer and scorer who can play either guard spot is undoubtedly tailor-made for the modern NBA. -- Jonathan Givony","The Rockets acquired the No. 29 pick from the Grizzlies on draft night as part of a trade package for No. 26 pick Wendell Moore, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported.   Washington has good size for a guard at just under 6-4 with a 6-8 wingspan, allowing him to see minutes at either backcourt spot and potentially even in three-guard lineups. His ability to make intelligent reads out of pick and roll and the touch he demonstrates on his floater and pull-up jumper gives him a relatively high floor when paired with his size and length. While not blessed with overwhelming speed or explosiveness, Washington plays with terrific pace and should excel with better spacing than he enjoyed at Kentucky, where he was mostly used off the ball and was usually surrounded with a plethora of non-shooters. Washington was really hitting his stride in SEC play before a series of injuries that he seemingly never fully recovered from derailed his freshman campaign. He looked out of shape and was dinged up in the pre-draft process, which caused his stock to tumble somewhat on draft night relative to where he was projected earlier in the year. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Peyton Watson",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UCLA","UCLA",NA,NA,NA,"January 5, 2022: (Top 100) -- It's no surprise that Watson hasn't been overly productive through the first nine games of his NCAA career. Watson's a late-bloomer who didn't play varsity basketball until his junior year at Long Beach Poly, arrived in Westwood with UCLA's best players -- Johnny Juzang and Jaime Jaquez Jr. -- playing his position. Moreover, upperclassmen Tyger Campbell and Jules Bernard generally have the ball when the Bruins' sophomore wing tandem doesn't. That quartet accounts for over 70% of UCLA's scoring.  But even with modest stats anticipated, few expected to see Watson, shooting just 35.1% from 2 and 10% from 3 through his first two months and ranking last in our top-100 in true shooting percentage while struggling to log double-digit minutes against competitive teams like Villanova and Marquette. UCLA hasn't played since Dec. 11 due to a three-week COVID-19 pause and will start conference play against Stanford on Jan. 6. If Watson wants to hold the interest of NBA scouts as a 2022 prospect, it's vital that he starts showing signs of growth. That growth doesn't have to come by scoring, as Watson is at his best when he's keeping it simple and putting less pressure on himself. The 19-year-old wasn't slotted as a potential lottery pick because he was projected as a go-to scorer or dynamic shot creator, it was his combination of physical tools (6-8 with a 7-1 wingspan) along with his fluidity and defensive energy. Plus, the glimpses he showed as a passer and midrange shooter -- he averaged 11.1 rebounds, 8.8 assists, 3.7 blocks and 1.8 steals per 40 minutes off the bench on the USA U19 gold-medal team -- also helped. While Watson is playing hard within his role under coach Mick Cronin -- 11.6 rebounds, 1.9 steals and 1.6 blocks per 40 minutes -- scouts will want to see the game start to slow down for him, as he has had his fair share of ""deer in headlights"" moments. He has missed his past 12 shots from the field over his past four games, misfiring on short pull-ups and finishes around the rim, while turning down catch-and-shoot 3s. Continuing to run the floor hard, staying active as a cutter and rebounder, drawing fouls, showing more glimpses as a passer and staying spaced to the corners for open 3s will be key. Defensively, picking up team concepts and evolving into a one-on-one stopper will help him stay on the floor. He has an excellent opportunity to show his defensive worth on Thursday against Stanford freshman wing Harrison Ingram, and two meetings against Ben Mathurin and Arizona are still on the schedule. Watson is known as a great teammate, and continuing to buy into Cronin's vision and becoming a valuable player on a winning UCLA team will go a long way for NBA scouts, whether he's playing five minutes a night or 20. -- Mike Schmitz October 12, 2021: (Top 100) -- Along with more than 15 NBA scouts, we attended UCLA's first open practice to get a look at Watson and a loaded Bruins team that could be headed for another deep NCAA tournament run. Coming off the bench for UCLA in practice, Watson doesn't have the easiest pathway to an ultraproductive freshman season with Johnny Juzang and Jaime Jaquez likely garnering a lot of the offensive volume. With that said, scouts got to see Watson in a role he'll likely play in the NBA -- defending, getting out in transition, attacking the rim, taking open 3s and moving the ball. As we saw at the U19 World Championships, the late-blooming Watson is far from the most polished prospect in this draft as his spot-up shooting is a work in progress.  But at 6-8, 200 pounds with a 7-0 wingspan, Watson is a rangy defender who can wreak havoc on and off the ball, can finish above the rim in space and is farther along as a ball handler and passer than most wings in his mold. I wouldn't expect Watson to put up gaudy box score numbers this season, but if he can add value defensively, make plays off the dribble in space, and shoot it well enough to instill some optimism that he can eventually evolve into a league-average spot shooter, he'll get no shortage of looks in the top 10. As we saw with Ziaire Williams going 10th after a tough freshman season at Stanford, the NBA is starved for rangy wings, and Watson fits that mold. Watson isn't Mick Cronin's only NBA prospect, however. Jaime Jaquez, 20, has been regarded as the best player in the gym for a lot of the preseason. A rugged 6-6 wing who has turned himself into a sniper from 3 and a capable facilitator off the bounce, Jaquez (No. 28 in the top 100) could garner first-round interest if he makes the jump most expect him to as a junior. Johnny Juzang (No. 39) remains firmly on the NBA radar as well thanks to his size, length, and versatile shooting stroke. While still improving defensively, Juzang, a 6-6 scorer, looked much more comfortable as a passer in practice, making heady reads out of pick-and-rolls and quick actions, which would go a long way in boosting his stock. -- Mike Schmitz July 14, 2021: (FIBA Under-19 World Cup) -- Watson played a minor role for this U.S. team at just 12.4 minutes per game, and struggled to get much going offensively. He hit just 2 of his 12 3-point attempts and looked fairly raw in terms of his frame, handle and shot selection.  While it's clear that Watson is much more of a long-term prospect than anyone else on this U.S. team, he did drop several hints of good things to come. His activity defensively was notable, evidenced by the 3.7 blocks and 1.8 steals he averaged per 40 minutes. Watson came into games looking to wreak havoc in passing lanes and had some impressive moments using his length and athleticism to cover ground, crash the glass and make plays defensively. Although he struggled to score, Watson did make some high-level passes within the flow of Team USA's offense, showing unselfishness and court vision that will aid in his development as his lanky frame and unpolished skill set evolve. A late bloomer who grew and emerged as a top-shelf prospect only recently, Watson is on a different trajectory than most. He'll be judged by the type of improvement he makes in the next year or so, as he has all of the ingredients NBA teams are looking for in players at his position long-term, giving him lottery-type upside.  -- Jonathan Givony December 29, 2020: (2022 Mock Draft) -- Still underrated nationally, Watson is a legitimate candidate to hear his name called toward the top of the 2022 draft if he continues on his current trajectory. A late bloomer who didn't start until his junior year of high school at California's Long Beach Poly, Watson stood only 6-foot-5.75 and weighed 170 pounds at USA basketball camp a year and a half ago. Now at least 6-foot-8, the rangy wing should be a pleasant surprise for NBA scouts who likely haven't seen him yet. His late-blooming status along with the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic have limited his national exposure and wiped away his AAU season, and his high school season on hold.  Fortunately, I was able to watch him play 5-on-5 with several 2020 draft prospects a couple of months ago, and he was the best player on the floor despite being just 18. It left me thinking he had all the ingredients of a future top-5 pick. Having already seen him play a do-it-all role as a 6-foot-6 high school junior, I was blown away by Watson's talent and development. Watson is a shifty shot-creator with high shoulders, outstanding footwork, a smooth handle and the type of toughness wiry wings with his frame need to make it at the NBA level. Thanks to his long strides, 7-foot wingspan, big reach and ability to change speeds and directions, Watson puts pressure on the rim in the open court and doesn't shy away from contact. Watson is comfortable with the ball in his hands, can create space to get to his jumper off the bounce and shows potential as a playmaker, with a solid, all-around feel for the game. Watson is still on the streaky side as a perimeter shooter and doesn't have a ton of experience having to fit in alongside other elite players given his trajectory. With that said, he is versatile offensively and is a willing defender both on and off the ball, rotating from the weak side for blocks and working to contest on the perimeter. Given his light frame and late rise, Watson might take some time to get comfortable in the Pac-12, but he is the type of shot-creating wing NBA scouts yearn for. So long as he can put together a productive season at UCLA under Mick Cronin in 2021-22, Watson should be viewed as a potential top-10 pick with considerable upside. -- Mike Schmitz","The Nuggets acquired this pick from Oklahoma City this off-season as part of a cap-clearing move for JaMychal Green. The Nuggets considered what packaging this pick with their own first-rounder -- at No. 21 -- could nab them on the trade market, but ultimately stood pat, electing to go with Peyton Watson.  Watson started the year projected as a top-10 pick but saw his stock slide after a disappointing season in which he averaged just 3.3 PPG on inefficient shooting, failing to earn the trust of the UCLA coaching staff who often opted for older, experienced, more physically developed players. Watson plays with great energy defensively, showing the ability to slow down guards and the length to eventually slide up to the power forward position as his frame fills out. Scouts who attended UCLA practices last season say he showed really intriguing flashes of passing and shot-making ability to bode well for his long-term outlook. A team picking Watson is betting on his physical tools, intensity, youth and their player development infrastructure to mold him into the type of multi-positional wing many teams look for in a Darius Bazley mold. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Andrew Nembhard",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gonzaga","GONZ",NA,NA,NA,"May 24, 2022: (Winners and losers of the 2022 NBA draft combine) -- Nembhard suffered a minor quad injury during the athletic testing portion of the NBA combine, which caused him to miss the opening game of the scrimmages, something that clearly disappointed him, judging by his dejected body language on the sideline. Nembhard refused to let the injury hold him back and elected to push through and play in the second game, something NBA teams said they appreciated considering he has a far more impressive body of work than the majority of players who decided to sit out. Nembhard proceeded to have one of the most productive NBA combine games in pre-draft camp history, posting 26 points and 11 assists.  Even more impressive than the line was the way Nembhard controlled the game from start to finish with his pace, handle and outstanding feel for the game, never looking sped up for an instant and making all the right reads and decisions while whipping the ball all over the floor off a live dribble, out of pick-and-roll with both hands. His 26 points felt effortless, as Nembhard never appeared to be forcing the issue, taking open shots that were presented to him and attacking the rim aggressively while showing a polished midrange and floater game. The success experienced by similar-minded backup point guards, including Tyus Jones and Monte Morris, helps a player like Nembhard, but the fact that he measured 6-foot-4.5 in shoes with the type of dimensions that multipositional NBA guards like Donte DiVincenzo, Grayson Allen and Alex Caruso possess should give him versatility to play in different lineup configurations. Nembhard leapfrogged over several players who elected to sit out the scrimmages with his strong play, and may ultimately get looks as high as the late first round on draft night. -- Jonathan Givony March 28, 2022: (Final Four week mock draft) -- Nembhard had one of his worst games of the season in a loss to Arkansas, scoring seven points on 2-for-11 shooting with three assists and five turnovers. Arkansas' game plan was evident from the start: pressuring Nembhard intensely from the point of attack and having their big man drop deep into the paint on every ball screen, challenging Nembhard to beat the Razorbacks as a scorer inside the arc.  Nembhard's limitations pulling up in midrange and finishing through contact around the basket were never more evident; he converted just 1 of 8 attempts from 2-point range and got to the line twice in a very physical game. He had some success pushing the ball in transition and finding teammates streaking up the floor, but Arkansas made a concerted effort to cut that off in the second half. Nembhard's limitations as a playmaker in the half court, streaky jump shot and lack of physicality defensively limit his upside as a NBA point guard, but there's still a role for players like him who can operate as a secondary facilitator, especially if he can continue to make strides with his shot. -- Jonathan Givony March 21, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Where they rank after the first weekend of the NCAA tournament) -- Nembhard showed why he's one of the best point guards in college on Saturday night, scoring 10 points in the last 4:37 to cap off a 23-point, 5-assist game in an 82-78 win over Memphis. Every time the Tigers made a run, Nembhard made a play, making two of his five 3s down the stretch while proving he's capable of punishing teams for darting under screens.  Nembhard is playing the best basketball of his career, averaging 15.0 points, 7.0 assists, and just 1.9 turnovers per games over his past 10 games while shooting 50% from 2 and 41% from 3. Nembhard has always been touted for his stellar basketball acumen and poise, but it's the improvements he's made as a shooter that has NBA teams looking at him with more clarity than in the past. Too often not even looking at the rim from 3 in previous years, Nembhard is even pulling from beyond NBA range on occasion, which has forced teams over the top of screens in pick and roll, allowing him to utilize his size and vision to either hit the roll man or spray the ball out to shooters with either hand. Nembhard also looks quicker with the ball in the open court as the conductor to Gonzaga's high-octane offense that ranks in the top-five in both pace and efficiency according to KenPom.com. Where Nembhard does need to prove he can add value is on the defensive end, where Gonzaga will hide him at times, in part to conserve his energy -- he's sat out less than five total minutes over his last five games. Although strong at 6-4 with the ability to hold his own in the post, which he did at times against a wing such as Memphis' Landers Nolley II, Nembhard isn't overly active off the ball, regularly standing straight up and down when he should be tagging or sinking inside the big to take away a drop off or offensive rebound. His on-ball focus and energy very much comes and goes. He's still not overly shifty with the ball in the half court on offense, which we saw on several Memphis switches when he either had to kill his dribble inside the arc or get off the ball. But Nembhard's recent surge -- particularly as a shooter -- should earn him looks in the mid to early second round, especially if he can lead the Bulldogs to a national title with a signature performance against a team such as Duke (a potential Elite 8 foe) along the way. -- Mike Schmitz","Nembhard had an outstanding four-year college career and brings significant experience at the FIBA level, as well as with the Canadian national team. He has good size for a point guard at 6-4 1/2 in shoes, and has steadily improved as a perimeter shooter throughout his college career. He was the engine behind one of the fastest-paced and most efficient offenses in college basketball, tasked with providing a steady hand alongside a pair of All-American frontcourt players in Chet Holmgren and Drew Timme. In Gonzaga's final six games of the season, he played 237 of a potential 240 minutes, becoming virtually indispensable for what many considered to be the best team in college basketball. What Nembhard lacks in pure explosiveness, scoring prowess, physicality and upside, he makes up for with the experience he offers and the willingness he shows to run a team and make teammates better, making him an easy player to pencil into a backup role early in his NBA career, while still having the flexibility to operate in multi-guard lineups as he often did throughout his college career. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Caleb Houstan",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Michigan","MICH",NA,NA,NA,"January 5, 2022: (Top 100) -- Coming off an outstanding showing at this summer's FIBA U19 World Cup by leading Canada to a bronze medal while ranking as one of the best scorers at the event, Houstan, a top-10 recruit and two-time high school national champion, looked like a likely candidate to emerge as a one-and-done lottery pick. Things haven't been nearly as smooth as expected two months into the season. Houstan has struggled to score with consistency or efficiency, alternating between looking passive and forcing the issue inside and outside the arc, while looking physically overwhelmed. I sat courtside this past weekend in Orlando, Florida, as Houstan had his worst game thus far in a blowout loss to UCF, scoring just one point in 25 minutes while shooting 0-for-7 from the field. Michigan has been one of the biggest disappointments of the season, a preseason top-five team that's now 7-6 and without any wins over projected NCAA tournament teams. Houstan looked like a completely different player in high school and this past summer with the Canadian national team, playing with confidence and showing versatility as a ball handler, passer, defender and shooter, while playing through contact effectively and putting his teams on his back in clutch moments. NBA scouts will want to see a lot more of that in Big Ten play, as he has lacked burst, explosiveness and aggressiveness while having his shot blocked frequently. Houstan will need to be much more like the 41% 3-point shooter he was in high school than the 31% he has converted thus far in college, while also doing a much better job defensively, something that used to be his calling card. Houstan isn't the first blue-chip prospect to need more time to adjust to the college game. Still only 18, Houstan could benefit from another year at Michigan to add bulk, regain his confidence and find more consistency on both ends of the floor, but the next few months could still give us a better gauge on his potential. -- Jonathan Givony July 14, 2021: (FIBA Under-19 World Cup) -- Houstan had an outstanding tournament, leading Canada to a bronze medal and showcasing an all-around game that should make him one of the best two-way players in college basketball as a freshman. Known as a spot-up shooter earlier in his career, Houstan struggled badly with his jumper (11-of-58 from 3, 19%) in Latvia, but showed impressive versatility as a ball handler, passer and finisher, attacking the rim relentlessly, playing through contact, extending gracefully for layups with both hands around the basket and coming up huge for Canada late in games on several occasions. Houstan was also one of the most impactful defenders at the tournament, demonstrating elite awareness off the ball as well as the ability to get up and guard smaller players with his quick feet and tough-minded approach. Houstan's shooting percentages will likely look better in a more compact role at Michigan, and NBA teams will surely be attracted to the versatility he brings on the wing as well as his cerebral approach. He made a case to be considered a potential top-five pick next year.-- Jonathan Givony April 7, 2021: (GEICO Nationals) -- The Michigan-bound Houstan earned a spot on the all-tournament team by leading Montverde in scoring and coming up with several clutch baskets in both the semifinals and finals, something that has become routine for him over the years. He made a name for himself early in his career for his perimeter shooting ability and backed that up by making 41% of his 3-pointers and 82% of his free throws in the 25 games this season for which we have data (per Synergy Sports Technology).  Where Houstan really shined most vividly was with his work on the defensive end, where he displays the maturity, technique and awareness of a player in his late 20s rather than someone who just turned 18. With the size to defend guards, wings and forwards alike, Houstan covers ground extremely well, plays with strong intensity and shows an excellent understanding of his team's schemes, particularly with the rotations he makes off the ball. While not quite the same player, Houstan will remind Michigan fans of Franz Wagner with the pace, efficiency and approach he brings to the table. Due to his role and the amount of star power on Montverde, Houstan doesn't see all that many opportunities to create for himself or others out of a ball screen or in one-on-one situations, something scouts will want to see more of as his career moves on.-- Jonathan Givony January 19, 2021: (GEICO Nationals) -- On a strong Montverde team, Houstan was a star in his own role -- spacing the floor from the perimeter, being a key playmaking cog, coming off screens on occasion and playing excellent defense. Despite standing 6-8, Houstan was one of the best shooters at the NIBC (42% on 3s), consistently on point if able to step into 3-pointers with his feet set. He does an excellent job of moving off the ball and finding opportunities to get his shot off in the open floor, and shows some flashes of being able to get his jumper off the bounce or coming off curls. More fluid than he is explosive, Houstan's ball-handling and overall shot-creation ability remain works in progress, though he's savvy with the way he moves the ball and generates easy shots for teammates within the flow of the offense. Houstan's feel for the game shows up especially with the way he defends off the ball, and he's almost always in the right spots positionally.  Houstan will be an easy player for Juwan Howard to integrate into Michigan's roster next year thanks to his positional size, skill, feel and willingness to do the little thing. He's attractive for a lot of the same reasons from an NBA perspective, but finding a way to ramp up his aggressiveness and finding a little more volume without sacrificing efficiency will make him an even more coveted prospect. -- Jonathan Givony","Coming off an outstanding showing at last summer's FIBA U19 World Cup, leading Canada to a bronze medal while ranking as one of the best scorers at the event, the top-10 recruit and two-time high school national champion looked like an easy candidate to emerge as a one-and-done lottery pick. Alas, that's not how things developed, as Houstan struggled badly to put the ball in the basket with any type of consistency or efficiency all season, often looking physically overwhelmed on both ends of the floor.  Houstan looked like a different player in high school and with the Canadian national team, playing with significantly more confidence and showing excellent versatility as a ball handler, passer, defender and shooter, while playing through contact far more effectively and putting his teams on his back in clutch moments.  Houstan had an even more mystifying pre-draft process, turning down quite a few workouts and an invite to the NBA Combine, seemingly comfortable with the feedback he received from a team before conducting several late workouts -- perhaps signaling that the ""promise"" many teams saw in him didn't actually materialize. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Christian Koloko",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arizona","ARIZ",NA,NA,NA,"March 28, 2022: (Final Four week mock draft) -- After exploding for 28 points, 12 rebounds and 3 blocks versus TCU, Koloko struggled to carry that momentum over to the Houston game, during which his lack of physicality showed on the defensive glass against aggressive bigs like Josh Carlton (five offensive rebounds in 27 minutes). Koloko had difficulty playing through contact on the other end down the stretch, shooting just 2-of-6 from 2-point range after ranking 16th in the NCAA in true shooting percentage and shooting an impressive 72% at the rim in the half court this season.  Koloko's postseason run should still be viewed as a success for the 21-year-old Cameroon native. He showcased everything from footwork to touch to improved vision to aggression on the offensive glass against TCU. He averaged 15.2 points, 8.6 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 3.0 blocks and 1.2 steals while shooting almost 70% from 2 over his last five games. He had his issues with the size of TCU big Eddie Lampkin on the glass and defensively, and Koloko still looks somewhat awkward and mechanical in his movements. He'll also get scored on at the rim a bit more than you'd expect given his tools. But Koloko is surely one of the most improved players in the country, and at 7-foot-1 with a 7-foot-5 wingspan, impressive agility and improved defensive fundamentals, he has a clear-cut NBA role as a vertical spacer, rim protector and pick-and-roll defender. On top of that, he is a sound free throw shooter with some untapped shooting potential. While Arizona found a ton of success with its two-big lineup of Koloko and Oumar Ballo, Koloko will surely look even more dynamic as a roller with NBA spacing. What could really take Koloko's game to the next level is tapping into the passing ability he flashed down the stretch of the season. He made a few encouraging reads against the Cougars, including a high-low pass to Ballo and a post kickout to the opposite wing. Koloko delivered the pass that led to a Ben Mathurin poster dunk and finished with six assists against Wright State and four assists against Stanford in the Pac-12 tournament. While every NBA team can use a run-and-jump center in the Mitchell Robinson mold a la Koloko, proving he can play out of short rolls and handoffs gives him far more upside and would allow him to remain on the floor late in games, in addition to his switchability. Despite his outstanding junior campaign, Koloko has no shortage of competition at the center spot, as this draft is loaded with 5s from first-round locks like Mark Williams and Walker Kessler to projected second-rounders like international bigs Ismael Kamagate, Khalifa Diop and Ariel Hukporti. Overall, Koloko was an integral player in Arizona's incredible season under first-year head coach Tommy Lloyd, as few prospects in the country were able to change games defensively like Koloko as a rim protector and switch defender, while giving Mathurin and Dalen Terry a consistent lob threat in the pick-and-roll. Should Koloko continue getting stronger, improving his ability to play through contact and showing progress as a passer, it's easy to see him carving out a consistent role in the NBA, even early on in his career. You can't say about a lot of the bigs in this draft. Overall, Koloko didn't solidify himself as a first-round selection with his play against Houston, but he has shown enough on both ends of the floor to warrant consideration anywhere in range of the pick Nos. 25 to 40, especially for a playoff team in need of a backup center. -- Mike Schmitz March 16, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- The Pac-12 defensive player of the year and most improved player, Koloko is on pace to become the best shot-blocker in Arizona history in the next few games. His 7-foot-4 wingspan, outstanding mobility and quickness getting off his feet make him a force both around the rim as well as covering ground on the perimeter, where he's often asked to guard smaller players in Arizona's jumbo lineups. He's an excellent finisher one of college basketball's most prolific dunkers, and a much-improved offensive player in general. Koloko's thin frame, lack of physicality and developing feel for the game, which manifests itself in foul trouble, point-blank misses and struggles keeping up with the speed of the game are things NBA scouts will want to learn more about in high-stakes matchups with pro-sized frontcourts as the competition stiffens. -- Givony November 30, 2021: (Top 100 preview) -- A bit player in his first two seasons at Arizona, Koloko is developing into a star as a junior, helping Tommy Lloyd start his first season 6-0 and climbing from unranked to the No. 11 team in the country thanks to wins over Michigan and Wichita State. Koloko's numbers -- 25.3 points, 11.7 rebounds, 5.5 blocks, 2.6 assists and 1.6 steals per-40 minutes, shooting 71% from the field and 78% from the free throw line -- are some of the best in the country.  With his 7-4 wingspan, much improved 230-pound frame and outstanding mobility, Koloko is the anchor of Arizona's staunch defense and is demonstrating impressive versatility covering ground on the perimeter as well as rotating to contest and block shots around the rim. Offensively, Koloko has taken a major step forward with his skill level and awareness as well, showing a knack for operating out of ball-screens and hand-offs while providing a steady presence as a lob-catcher thanks to his huge standing reach and improved hands and touch. NBA scouts have seen parts of this movie before, with Koloko showing signs of taking the next step with his productivity and approach, only to be disappointed as he crashed to earth. This time feels a lot more sustainable, especially seeing the way he thoroughly dominated All-American Hunter Dickinson on both ends of the floor in the shellacking of Michigan, but only time will tell if Koloko has indeed taken the next step and is ready to be considered a legitimate first round pick. -- Jonathan Givony","The Raptors went on a late-season run to claim the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, eventually bowing out in six games, but showing significant promise with one of the youngest teams in the NBA that is mostly under contract for the near future. The Raptors surprised many last year by passing on Jalen Suggs in favor of Scottie Barnes, a move that in hindsight looks brilliant thus far considering Barnes won Rookie of the Year honors and appears to be a seamless fit with the team's culture and style of play. Toronto traded their first-round pick (No. 20) to San Antonio to move down 13 slots to No. 33 in exchange for acquiring Thaddeus Young, who is now a free agent. While likely to resign Chris Boucher this offseason, the Raptors are still on the hunt for a starting-caliber center to complement their deep stable of wings and forwards that made up one of the NBA's most switchable defenses.   The Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year and Most Improved Player, Koloko's 102 blocks as a junior is tied for Arizona's single-season record. His 7-5 wingspan, outstanding mobility and quickness getting off his feet make him a force both around the rim as well as covering ground on the perimeter, where he's often asked to guard smaller players in Arizona's jumbo lineups. He's an excellent finisher, one of college basketball's most prolific dunkers and a much-improved offensive player in general. Koloko's thin frame, lack of physicality and developing feel for the game, which manifests itself in foul trouble, point-blank misses and struggles keeping up with the speed of the game are things he'll have to improve on to carve out a long-term NBA career, but he has no shortage of talent and more upside than your average 22-year-old due to his late start playing organized basketball. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jaylin Williams",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arkansas","ARK",NA,NA,NA,"March 28, 2022: (Final Four week mock draft) -- Posting four double-doubles in his four-game run in the NCAA tournament, Williams showed what makes him a legitimate NBA prospect, as well as the things he needs to work on to solidify himself as a first-round pick. In a game Arkansas lost by nine points, Williams was the only player on the team with a positive plus/minus, finishing plus-3 after seeing his team take a major hit when foul trouble forced him to the bench late in the first half.  Williams is an unorthodox prospect in many ways: He isn't a consistent shooter; he will struggle at times finishing in traffic due to his average-level explosiveness; and his best skill at the moment is sliding in for charges, as he leads all of college basketball in them. At 6-foot-10 and 232 pounds with a 7-foot-1 wingspan, he is somewhat caught between big man positions, while not bringing the type of consistent shooting range you would hope to see from someone who will likely need to play alongside another big due to Williams' lack of rim protection. What Williams does bring is tremendous toughness on both ends of the floor, a trait that will help carve a place in the NBA. He is an outstanding passer and an excellent rebounder, and he shows the type of skill and touch around the basket that bodes well for becoming a more versatile offensive player. Still only 19 years old, Williams expanding his shooting range, maximizing his frame and becoming an even more versatile defender on the perimeter would help solidify his standing as a draft prospect. It appears likely that Williams will at least check to see where he stands in the eyes of the NBA this spring, but returning to Fayetteville, where he'll have the opportunity to pair with Nick Smith -- a strong candidate for the No. 1 pick in 2023 -- could be compelling. -- Jonathan Givony","Drawing comparisons to Kevon Looney of the Warriors, Williams is an unorthodox prospect in many ways. He's not a consistent shooter and sometimes struggles to finish in traffic due to his average explosiveness. His best skill at the moment lies with his ability to slide in for charges -- in which he led all of college basketball -- which isn't particularly valued at the NBA level. At 6-10, 237 pounds with a 7-1 wingspan, he's somewhat caught between big man positions, while not bringing the type of consistent shooting range you would hope to see from someone who will likely need to play alongside another big man, due to his lack of rim-protection and occasional struggles guarding the post.  What Williams does bring is an extraordinarily high basketball IQ, as well as tremendous toughness on both ends of the floor, something that all but guarantees he will play a role in the NBA -- and likely for a long time. He's an outstanding passer, an excellent rebounder, and shows the type of skill and touch around the basket that bodes well for his ability to become a more versatile offensive player in time. Still only 19 years old, expanding his shooting range, maximizing his frame and becoming an even more versatile defender on the perimeter would go a long way in solidifying his chances of latching on with a team long-term. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Max Christie",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Michigan State","MSU",NA,NA,NA," March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Christie is a 6-foot-6 guard who has the type of footwork to develop into both an on-the-move shooter and sound defender as he continues to grow in the toughness, confidence and experience departments. When Christie's jumper is falling, it's easy to see him getting looks in the late first-round, projecting somewhere between Landry Shamet and Primo on his best days. Yet, Christie's shooting has been all over the place this season, as he's knocking down just 28.6% from beyond the arc over his past 10 games and has a tendency to play a sped-up style, running from open shots on occasion and not quite exuding the type of self-belief that would suggest he's ready to make an NBA jump. He's also shooting just 40% at the rim in the half-court, converting 16 shots at the rim in 33 games. With all that said, Christie has picture-perfect shooting mechanics, can rise up off the dribble with ease, and holds some defensive potential as well given his projectable frame and feet, even if he gives up too many straight-line drives to the rim at this stage. We'll learn more about Christie's ability to take and make big shots in clutch moments during Michigan State's NCAA tournament run, which will either put scouts at ease about the 19-year-old's underwhelming freshman campaign or suggest that he clearly needs more seasoning at the collegiate ranks before making the pro leap. -- Mike Schmitz November 11, 2021: (Mock Draft) -- Christie had a forgettable night, scoring 9 points on 10 shots while being unable to impact the game outside of converting a handful of smooth 3-pointers. Christie doesn't jump off the page physically on first glance at 6-foot-5.5, 192 pounds with a 6-8 wingspan, but has the type of fluidity, feel for the game and scoring instincts that every NBA team is actively seeking, especially from 18-year-old prospects. Christie put on a dynamic shot-making clinic in warm-ups that hinted at impressive things to come down the road, backing up some of the considerable buzz he's received for his preseason showings in practice and exhibition play in East Lansing.  Once the bright lights of Madison Square Garden came on in real-game action, Christie looked a lot more like an 18-year-old who played for a small-town high school and missed considerable experience against high-level competition over the past two years due to the pandemic, looking a little timid and passive on both ends of the floor. Despite his struggles, Christie's long-term talent is obvious, and there's little doubt that he'll be in demand among NBA teams whenever he decides it's time for him to make the leap to the pros. Christie is clearly in line for a considerable role and platform, as evidenced by the 31 minutes he played despite getting absolutely lit up defensively, meaning it's very likely that he'll have some major scoring explosions as the season moves on, which will only help build his case as a potential top-20 pick. As Josh Primo, the No. 12 pick in the 2021 NBA draft, showed last year, NBA teams are actively seeking out prospects in his mold and might not mind having to be patient with their development. -- Jonathan Givony","Just one year removed from winning a championship, the Lakers were one of the NBA's big disappointments this past season, finishing with a dismal 33-49 record that saw them miss the NBA's play-in game altogether. A disastrous trade for Russell Westbrook and a litany of injuries, including to centerpiece Anthony Davis threaten to squander the final years of LeBron James' illustrious career, despite posting some of the best numbers we've seen since he was drafted in 2003. The Lakers were able to buy their way back into the draft by acquiring a fairly high second-round pick in exchange for cash and a second-round pick in 2028. The Lakers have done well in the draft under assistant GM Jesse Buss, picking quite a few contributors that became parts of various trades they made over the years. With only half a dozen players under contract for next season, the Lakers have quite a few holes to plug on their roster and need to find contributors at every position either in free agency or with this pick.  Christie is a sweet-shooting 6-6 guard with a 6-9 wingspan who has the type of footwork and mechanics to develop into both an on-the-move shooter and sound defender as he continues to grow in the toughness, confidence and experience departments. When Christie's jumper is falling, it's easy to see why he was such a highly-touted prospect earlier in his career. Yet, Christie's jumper didn't fall as much as hoped this season, hitting just 32% of his attempts from beyond the arc. He has a tendency to play a sped-up style, running from open shots on occasion and not quite exuding the type of self-belief that would suggest he's ready to make an NBA jump. He also struggled badly inside the arc this season, converting just 43% of his 2-point attempts and rarely getting to the free-throw line. With all that said, Christie has picture-perfect shooting mechanics, can rise up off the dribble with ease and holds some defensive potential given his projectable frame and feet while only being 19 years old, making him the type of player who NBA teams will want to monitor for many years moving forward. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Gabriele Procida",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fortitudo Bologna","Fortitudo Bologna",NA,NA,NA,"April 29, 2021: (Intriguing long-term prospects) -- Out of all the prospects I evaluated, Procida is the prospect I'd feel most comfortable stamping as a sleeper with a real chance to play in the NBA and outplay his projected draft slot -- whether he targets the 2021 draft or not. At almost 6-foot-8 with wide shoulders, a sweet shooting stroke and excellent fluidity, Procida has the ingredients to eventually carve out a role at the highest level if he can continue to improve as a ball handler, decision-maker and defender.  Watching him warm up in Brescia, Italy, for about an hour, it didn't take long to realize that he is one of the best shooters in this draft class, with the ability to knock down shots on the move and finish above the rim in space. On the season, the 18-year-old Italian player is shooting 42% from 3 on 81 attempts in his first full season at the first division level, shooting the ball with confidence, even sprinting off screens or rising into pull-ups. As is often the case with young players, Procida was on a short leash the night I evaluated him, playing six total minutes after he was sent to the bench for the rest of the game following a missed dunk and blown defensive assignment at the end of the first half. The game can move a bit fast for him on both ends of the floor right now. and he is certainly not ready to play in an NBA playoff game tomorrow. He is still a bit slight in stature and far from a finished product physically. But from studying his film extensively, it became clear that he fits an NBA prototype and has the energy and baseline physical ability needed to hold his own defensively as his body matures. Procida also does a lot of the little things you need from role players -- regularly crashing the offensive glass for tip dunks, jumping the passing lanes for a steal or scampering back door for an easy finish. Whether it's Kevin Huerter or Furkan Korkmaz, size and shooting is king on the wing in today's NBA, and Procida can offer both to an organization willing to invest in him long term as a draft-and-stash prospect. A late bloomer who is still somewhat unknown to most NBA executives, Procida is the type of prospect who could have broken out in a Nike Hoop Summit type of setting in a normal year without a pandemic.  -- Mike Schmitz","Standing 6-7 with a 6-8 wingspan, Procida has excellent size for a wing and is a bouncy finisher in space. His appeal in NBA circles is deeply rooted in his perimeter shooting stroke as he is reliable with his feet set while also flashing some potential shooting on the move and off the dribble. Procida isn't especially dynamic with the ball, is an average passer and is not adept at finishing over length, but could grow into the type of shooter who can use his gravity to his advantage to open up other parts of his game. His explosiveness allows him to make some plays defensively, but his lack of length, strength and experience hindered him from playing significant minutes last season primarily because of how green he is on that end of the floor. Nevertheless, he just turned 20 and fits a clear mold as a dynamic shooter a team brings off the bench in the Furkan Korkmaz mold. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jaden Hardy",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"G League Ignite","G League Ignite",NA,NA,NA,"December 22, 2021: (Mock Draft) -- Hardy has had a somewhat disappointing season for Ignite, scoring inefficiently, appearing disinterested defensively and often looking selfish with his approach. He looked to be building positive momentum earlier in the week with strong performances against Salt Lake City and in the opening game of the Showcase, before completely falling apart in an ugly blowout loss to Austin, reminding scouts of how poor he's looked for much thus far.  Hardy is shooting a dismal 40% from 2-point range and 27% from beyond the arc, while posting a negative assist to turnover ratio. He's struggled to generate good looks for himself this season, regularly freezes out teammates and has been a defensive liability for most of the season. NBA scouts in attendance questioned whether he has the quickness or feel to play the only style of basketball he seemingly knows. Others pointed out that his team strung together back-to-back wins and played much better when he and his teammate/brother Amauri Hardy were suspended for two games in Stockton due to a violation of COVID protocols. While Hardy's chances of being a top-five pick like he was projected in the preseason are looking unlikely by the day, he still has time to solidify his candidacy as a top-10 pick. Luckily for him, few prospects have emerged in the college ranks and flashed the type of star-potential NBA teams look for in the mid to late lottery portions of the draft, putting him in a large group of prospects with major question marks. It will be interesting to see what type of adjustments Hardy makes as the season moves along, or whether he'll continue to play the type of empty-calorie, volume scoring style that's mostly been his M.O. thus far. -- Jonathan Givony October 29, 2021: (G League Ignite preview) -- Standing 6-4 with a solid frame, a 6-9 wingspan and shooting range from half court, Hardy possesses a lot of the qualities teams look for in a modern NBA guard. Thirty-foot pull-ups and step-back 3s have never been more valuable, and few teenagers in the world are as advanced as Hardy in terms of off-the-dribble shooting. He has spent time training with Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard, picking his brain about the importance of pace. He has been in the gym with Brooklyn Nets guard James Harden, studying his creativity, feel for the game, and how he maintains balance on his go-to moves. Sitting down for a 40-minute film session with the Detroit native, his self-belief is clear.  ""I feel like I'm the best player in this class honestly,"" said Hardy, whose brother, Amauri Hardy, was also signed by the Ignite. ""There's a lot of great players in this class -- Chet [Holmgren], Paolo [Banchero], those are my guys. I just feel like my game stands out more. I feel like my game translates better to this modern NBA."" With guards ranging from Bradley Beal to Lillard to Devin Booker all thriving, Hardy has a point. One year after winning Nevada Gatorade Player of the Year as a junior at Coronado High School, he averaged over 40 a game before opting out of his senior year in January after the season was canceled because of COVID-19. His team went on to play as prep school Air Nado. Hardy once went for 62 in a high school game. He dropped 46 against premier program Prolific Prep. Watching his high school tape, he regularly knocked down 3s from just inside half court while also proving to be strong off screens, dribble handoffs, and out of pick-and-roll, elevating in midrange or getting to the rim and finishing with creativity. Simply put, he was the best scorer in high school basketball. Evaluating Hardy live for the first time in over two years, it didn't take long to realize his shooting stroke is his clear strength. Given his confidence, instincts and shooting touch, Hardy could rank among the G League's top-10 scorers this season, which we saw from Green as he averaged 18.7 points over 32.3 minutes in 16 games. But while Green is dynamic, seemingly with springs in his legs, Hardy doesn't have the same burst, shift or bounce, forcing him to rely more on skill and timing. Like Green and other recent top pick Anthony Edwards at the same stage, Hardy is still learning how to play an efficient brand of basketball. With ultimate freedom to pull up from anywhere in high school, Hardy has quite a bit of room for growth as a decision-maker. The Ignite staff is emphasizing quicker decisions, being more purposeful with his dribble and learning how to play when the ball isn't in his hands. Given his size at 6-4, proving he can play on the ball as a lead guard would only add to his intrigue, as making pick-and-roll reads remains a growth area. Buying in defensively is a priority as well for Hardy, who often was lackadaisical on that end of the floor at the high school level. If Hardy can address some of those areas it's not out of the question that he challenges Holmgren and Banchero as a top-2 NBA draft pick, as there's no other prospect in this draft with his 3-level scoring ability. Hardy's debut pro season shouldn't come without its lumps, however, and he had his struggles in live action during my recent visit, understandable given his lack of experience at the FIBA level. If Hardy puts forth an inefficient, uneven season where he's only hunting his own shots, scouts might wonder if he's better suited for a bucket-getting role like a Jordan Poole, Jordan Clarkson, Cam Thomas or Anfernee Simons than the stars he models his game after, especially with highly touted prospects like Jabari Smith and Jalen Duren right behind him in our Top-100.  -- Mike Schmitz","ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the Kings traded the No. 37 pick to the Mavericks for two future second-round picks.   Hardy started the season projected as a top-5 pick, but saw his stock slide drastically after an extremely inefficient season that was marred by poor shot selection, too many turnovers and quite a few defensive lapses that contributed to Ignite's 9-18 record with him on the court. For Hardy, the amount of freedom he was given on an Ignite team with very few go-to scoring options besides himself may not have been the best thing for him as he hunted shots relentlessly all season and never really learned the value of slowing down, letting the game come to him and doing more little things that contribute to winning.   After a year with the ultimate green light, the best thing possible for Hardy may be being asked to dial it back and play a team-friendly style looking for singles and doubles rather than seeking out the home-run play on every possession. Digging beneath the surface, there are enough indicators to show the potential Hardy offers offensively, with the incredible shooting range he offers, dynamic shot-making off the dribble, and occasional flashes of passing and scoring touch around the rim that hint at good things to come for the 19-year-old. Hardy's 6-foot-9 wingspan and solid build gives him the framework of someone who can hold his own offensively as his discipline and intensity improves, and there are some things to work with here if his bad habits in terms of effort and off-ball gambling can be improved. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Kennedy Chandler",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tennessee","TENN",NA,NA,NA," March 21, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Where they rank after the first weekend of the NCAA tournament) -- No. 3 seed Tennessee lost in the Round of 32 to No. 11 seed Michigan, but it's difficult to call Chandler's performance over the past two months anything but a major win, as he clearly established himself as one of the best point guards in college basketball after an up-and-down start.  Chandler has played mistake-free, highly efficient basketball over the past 15 games, looking on another level confidence-wise, shooting 47% from beyond the arc and playing lockdown defense. Winners of 13 of their past 14 games going into Saturday, Tennessee shot just 2-for-18 from 3, with Wolverines coach Juwan Howard electing to send a series of aggressive traps and double teams at Chandler and force anyone but him to beat them, something that proved to be a winning strategy. Chandler proved his point, showing the type of burst, ball-handling, creativity and aggressiveness every NBA covets. He did a masterful job of playing off hesitation moves and changing gears to get anywhere he wanted on the floor, dished out nine assists, hit an array of pull-up jumpers, finished skillfully around the basket and got in passing lanes repeatedly. Although his team didn't win, it was encouraging to see how assertive Chandler was all game long after being criticized earlier in the season for being too tentative on the floor and too quiet off it -- areas he's made major strides with. After a roller-coaster start, Chandler's draft stock is back where it started at the beginning of the season, vying to be the first point guard off the board after Jaden Ivey. NBA teams have long been reluctant to hand the keys of their team over to smaller guards, which is why measurements and the way he performs in workouts against other touted prospects at his position will ultimately determine when his name is called. Chandler took a circuitous route but appears to have come out a much better player after a strong development season that will likely position him well going into his NBA rookie season. -- Jonathan Givony March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Although undersized at 5-foot-11 barefoot, Chandler is a shifty, dynamic point guard who gets wherever he wants on the floor thanks to his tight handle and skill level. He is a natural with the ball in his hands, changing speeds and directions at will to either generate offense for himself or his teammates. A capable pull-up shooter (37% from 3), Chandler is a nightmare for opposing defenses to keep in front, and he has the vision to spray the ball out to shooters or drop it off to bigs once he gets a piece of the paint. He's a disruptive defender, as well, thanks to his quickness, instincts and 6-foot-5 wingspan that has allowed him to rip opposing guards on the perimeter, swipe the ball on digs and even block occasional jumpers as a key cog in Tennessee's top-three defense.  There are only four sub-6-foot-1 guards who play at least 15 minutes per game in the NBA this season, meaning Chandler will have to be viewed as a special talent to warrant a high draft pick. Not always the most vocal leader, scouts will be studying how Chandler takes command of the team in key moments throughout the NCAA tournament. -- Mike Schmitz Jan. 26, 2022: (Mock Draft) -- Chandler has had a roller coaster of a freshman year, coming up flat in some of Tennessee's biggest games this season while showing significant potential in others. Opinions on how to view him as an NBA prospect vary drastically from team to team and scout to scout, which may be partially due to the Vols' extremely difficult schedule. No team has played tougher defenses thus far according to KenPom, which has surely provided for a difficult learning curve for the skinny 19-year=old point guard. At his best, Chandler is clearly one of the most talented point guards in the college game, blessed with incredible speed and burst, shifty ball-handling ability, terrific creativity as a finisher and passer and flashes of real shot-making ability. His quickness, basketball instincts and length are evidenced by the way he gets in passing lanes, averaging more steals than any player in the final ESPN 100 for 2021. With that said, he's looked surprisingly tentative for big parts of the season, passing up open looks regularly, appearing reluctant to use his speed to his advantage, struggling from the free-throw line and looking too often to the sidelines for guidance instead of playing off his outstanding instincts. Some of that may be due to the rigid system he plays in, where he's mostly surrounded by non-shooters in traditional lineups with multiple big men. That doesn't explain why Chandler, a career 80% free-throw shooter entering college (on a healthy sample size) is making just 60% of his attempts at the stripe this season, though. Scouts will hope to see Chandler's confidence grow as the year moves on and he hopefully finds a little more swagger and on-court personality to match his terrific talent -- sometimes it takes longer for freshman guards to find their footing. Questions already exist about Chandler's size (measured 5-foot-11 barefoot), thin frame and his struggles shooting off the dribble, leaving teams to ponder whether he projects as a solid backup or if he can evolve into more than that as his NBA career progresses. With 11 SEC games still left to play, along with the SEC and NCAA tournaments, there's quite a bit of time left for Chandler to show growth, especially with many of the team's toughest games already in the rearview. -- Jonathan Givony","ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the Grizzlies traded for No. 38 pick Kennedy Chandler from the Spurs for a future second-round pick and cash.  Chandler was one of college's most talented point guards, especially in the second half of the season, blessed with incredible speed and burst, shifty ball-handling ability, terrific creativity as a finisher and passer, and flashes of real shot-making ability. Despite being on the smaller side, Chandler's quickness, basketball instincts and length made him a significant asset defensively last season, allowing him to make a living getting in passing lanes while also being a real pest on the ball. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Khalifa Diop",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gran Canaria","Gran Canaria",NA,NA,NA,"February 22, 2022: (Mock Draft and Top 100 update) -- Diop made his senior team debut with Gran Canaria in a Euroleague game nearly three years ago as a then-17 year old, but hasn't fully entrenched himself in the rotation of one of Spain's top teams until this season, which is understandable considering the level at which he competes.  Still the same age as some college freshmen, Diop is playing some of the best basketball of his career as of late, starting many of his team's recent games and establishing himself as one of the most versatile defensive big men in the European game.  Diop is as mobile and energetic a big man as you'll find in this class, tasked with putting out fires all over the floor for Gran Canaria, whether trapping opponents at half-court, switching or hedging ball-screens well beyond the 3-point line, helping off his man to double the post or protect the rim, and making some tremendous plays recovering from the perimeter to meet opponents at the summit. He generates quite a few more turnovers than the boxs core gives him credit for on a nightly basis, and his versatility as a 7-foot, 250 pound big man already well-versed in the nuances of high-level pick-and-roll defense should give him an immediate role to grow into early in his NBA career, despite being foul-prone and just an average defensive rebounder due to his occasional struggles keeping up with the speed of the game.  Offensively, Diop has made steady progress with his skill level and feel for the game, becoming more reliable catching, passing and finishing around the basket, but has plenty of room to grow in this area still. He's a poor screener, lacks a degree of explosiveness operating off two feet in traffic, and isn't immune from missing point-blank shots in the paint. He doesn't have range on his jumper and is just a 59% free throw shooter, sometimes not really being guarded by opponents. He does make up for that with the energy he brings on the offensive glass, and will surprise you every game by showing flashes of a new-found skill, be it short-roll passing or left-hand finishing, but will always likely be considered an ""energy guy"" even at his peak.  What NBA teams think about Diop will likely largely depend on what they think about the level where he plays. For some, a 20-year old starting and finishing games at the ACB and EuroCup levels and making his presence felt on both ends of the floor will be extremely noteworthy, while others will point to his unremarkable numbers (6 points, 3.6 rebounds in 15 minutes per game) and prefer to target college big men instead.  Diop has a high floor as a NBA backup, but there are many teams who simply prefer to have highly skilled players on the floor at every position and won't be interested in a player in this mold, which could relegate him to the second round.  - Jonathan Givony ","Diop, who stands 7-feet with a 250-pound frame, is coming off an excellent ACB quarterfinal playoff series against arguably the best team in European basketball in Barcelona, posting 32 points and 12 rebounds in 55 minutes through three games. He's an exceptionally mobile big man who plays the game with tremendous intensity, is one of the most versatile defenders in this draft class and can still rotate fluidly to the paint to meet opponents at the summit and protect the rim.  Diop is as well-coached and experienced as any prospect, playing strong rotation minutes for 54 games on a team that made both the ACB and EuroCup playoffs. There are only a handful of 20-year-olds who could do what he did this season competing at the highest levels of competition in Europe, earning the trust of his coaching staff and having several stellar performances in important games.  While known for his defense, Diop has steadily improved offensively to the point that he's earned the trust of his coaching staff. He's one of the most prolific finishers in this draft class, averaging a dunk every 16 minutes he's on the floor, and is a capable passer out of short roll situations, even making occasional touch passes that hint at good things to come down the road. His hands can be suspect at times and he's still figuring out the nuances of screening and rolling, while his 57% from the free throw line this season doesn't suggest much potential to emerge as a floor-spacer anytime soon.  Even if Diop's upside is capped at that of a backup center in the NBA, the things he brings as a rim-runner, finisher, rim-protector and perimeter defender are very valuable. The fact that you can't find a single person who will say a bad thing about Diop's work ethic and approach has to be taken into account as well, as he's someone who clearly knows his role and isn't going to try to be someone he's not. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Bryce McGowens",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Nebraska","NEB",NA,NA,NA,"January 5, 2022: (Top 100) -- The leading scorer on a 6-8 Cornhuskers team, McGowens has proven to be one of the NCAA's more polarizing freshmen through his first 14 games. He can look like a surefire lottery pick some nights and a potential second-rounder on others. What will McGowens need to do to prove he belongs in the lottery conversation to scouts?  Upping his offensive efficiency against sturdier defenses while playing with more urgency defensively are the immediate challenges for the 19-year-old. In eight games against teams with a winning record, McGowens is averaging 14.6 points, 0.9 assists and 1.1 turnovers on 40% from 2 and 17% from 3 in 35.5 minutes. In six games against teams with losing records, McGowens is averaging 17.3 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.7 turnovers while shooting 70% from 2 and 37% from 3 in 30.4 minutes. Scouts saw the good and the bad during Nebraska's overtime loss to Ohio State on Sunday, arguably McGowen's toughest test of the season so far. The South Carolina native scored 18 points on 19 shots, knocking down a pair of deep 3s while showing his ability to change pace and get downhill to the rim and make a heady read out of pick-and-roll. But he also played a big role in Ohio State freshman Malaki Branham exploding for a career-best 35 points with his lackluster defense and had issues separating and finishing over 6-foot-7 forward E.J. Liddell. When McGowens gets going, it's easy to compare him to guards like Dejounte Murray of the San Antonio Spurs and Bones Hyland of the Denver Nuggets. He shoots it from well beyond the NBA line like Hyland, mixing in step-backs and hesitations to get into his pull-up. He's also capable of playing off hang dribbles to get into the paint, striding into slow-down floaters, unraveling his 6-9 wingspan into finesse finishes with either hand. But against more competitive teams, McGowens -- weighing in at 179 pounds -- has struggled to play through contact as a driver and finisher. When his early-clock deep 3s don't fall, he lacks other ways to consistently impact the game. Scouts will want to see McGowens defend more physically and with urgency. Looking forward, there's no easy out in the Big Ten. How will McGowens fare against other rising stars like Max Christie, Jaden Ivey and the aforementioned Davis? If McGowens can prove he's a better shooter than his 25% 3-point clip suggests (81% on free throws), take better shots, flash some semblance of point guard potential and show he's a willing defender, he'll have no shortage of suitors, even in the lottery. If the struggles against top-tier teams continue, his naysayers will view him as a volume scorer who needs time before he can help an NBA team. -- Mike Schmitz","ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the Timberwolves are trading the No. 40 pick to the Hornets.    McGowens is considered one of the most fluid and naturally gifted scorers among young wing players in this draft class, showing deep range on his pull-up jumper and creativity finishing with either hand around the basket. At 6-6 1/2 with a 6-9 wingspan, he has good positional size, even if his lanky 181-pound frame will need to add significant bulk to handle the rigors of the NBA. McGowens' inconsistent intensity level, particularly on the defensive end, will help determine what kind of NBA career he's able to carve out. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","E.J. Liddell",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ohio State","OSU",NA,NA,NA," March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- One of the most improved players in college, Liddell has turned himself into a first-round pick by modernizing his game on both ends of the floor as a powerful 4/5. He has trimmed down, evolved as a perimeter shooter (38% from 3), expanded his playmaking off the dribble, become an asset in switch situations and developed into a true defensive anchor for the Buckeyes thanks to his stellar timing and nonstop motor. Scouts still have questions about Liddell's long-term upside as he stands no taller than 6-foot-7 with average positional length, a flat jumper that might take time to adjust to the NBA line and a somewhat power-reliant game. Can Liddell score efficiently against NBA-caliber rim protectors? If not, is he a skilled enough shooter, passer and ball handler to be an asset on the perimeter? Does Liddell project as more of an energy guy or is he the next collegiate winner who scouts will overlook because of his less-than-stellar measurables, underrating his incredible intangibles, productivity, basketball IQ and toughness? Former college players ranging from Draymond Green to Grant Williams come to mind when watching Liddell. Leading the Buckeyes deep into March will go a long way in proving to NBA scouts that they should value Liddell's on-court impact and toughness over his perceived ""upside."" -- Mike Schmitz December 22, 2021: (Mock Draft) -- A poor showing at the NBA's G League Elite Camp last May caused Liddell to withdraw his name from the NBA draft and return to Ohio State for his junior season. He's responded with an All-American caliber campaign thus far, posting 20.6 points, 7.2 rebounds, 2.9 blocks and 2.7 assists per game with a spectacular 65% true shooting percentage, while looking like an ultra-versatile, two-way big NBA teams are actively seeking.  At 6-7, Liddell is undersized to play the 4 at the next level, but makes up for that with a near 7-foot wingspan and a chiseled 243-pound frame. He's one of the hardest working bigs in college and showed off his defensive prowess by locking up potential No. 1 pick Paolo Bachero. Liddell stymied Banchero into one of his worst performances of the season, while putting Ohio State over the top in a win over Duke. He is effective in bodying up bigger players in the post as he is switching onto smaller players on the perimeter by using his excellent feet, patience and length to get in opponents' air space. He's emerged as one of the best shot blockers in college, adept at flying in from the weakside to challenge shots as well as making chase-down blocks in transition. Offensively, Liddell has shown progress, going from being an undersized post bruiser to someone who can push off the defensive glass, initiate out of pick-and-rolls in a pinch, space the floor effectively (35% 3-point shooter) and attack closeouts. His ballhandling, passing and perimeter shooting are still areas to develop, but the jump he's made has been encouraging. Liddell has moved into the first round of our draft projections and can continue to rise with good showings in conference play and a deep run in the NCAA tournament. -- Jonathan Givony","Liddell modernized his game as a junior after a poor showing at the G League Elite Camp in 2021, turning himself into one of the best players in college basketball and winning All-America honors in turn. While his productivity trended up across the board, NBA scouts noted the way he expanded his shooting range, became a significantly more versatile defender on the perimeter and as a shot-blocker, and improved his playmaking ability. While Liddell is certainly undersized for a big man at 6-5 1/2 without shoes, his near 7-foot wingspan, outstanding energy level and excellent personality off the court gives him a high floor as a prospect. Questions about his skill level and ceiling ultimately kept him out of the first round, but there are plenty of players Liddell can point to in the NBA that are having considerable success despite similar shortcomings. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Trevor Keels",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Duke","DUKE","Keels is a powerful combo guard with the exact offensive versatility teams generally covet. A far better shooter than his percentages suggest, Keels can add value in catch-and-shoot situations while also picking apart a shifting defense out of second-side pick-and-roll opportunities. He does a nice job of playing at different speeds in ball screens, putting his defender in jail before either bouncing out for mid-range jumpers, hitting the roller in stride, spraying the ball out to a shooter circling up or re-attacking open space with his powerful 221-pound frame into a tough finish. From a skill perspective, Keels doesn't have a ton of true holes in his game given his ability to spot shoot, knock down tough pull-ups and make most basic reads -- he's averaging 3.9 assists and just 1.8 turnovers per 40 minutes on the season.  While his pass-dribble-shoot skill-set has shined bright in spurts all season long, it was Keels' defensive toughness that originally drew NBA scouts to the stocky 18-year-old guard. He's proven more than capable of taking on the defensive challenge against elite guards -- see Duke's win against Kentucky and TyTy Washington -- bringing the type of energy and toughness at the point of attack that coaches at all levels covet. He set the bar so high early on that his ball pressure and off ball intensity has fluctuated at times over the course of the season, but overall he's a hard-nosed on-ball defender who should be able to check either back court spot in the NBA regardless of his untraditional build. There's little downside to an ultra-confident guard like Keels, as he's at the very least a longtime rotation player in the NBA. ","What is Keels' elite NBA skill? He hasn't yet proven himself to be a true threat as a shooter (32.5% from 3), isn't all that quick or explosive off the dribble, and isn't quite the true lead guard to hand the keys of a franchise to. Although he has an incredibly high floor given all the things he does well on both ends, his oversized frame, lack of elite length (6-7 wingspan), average burst and major struggles playing in traffic as a finisher (46.3% at the rim in the half court) will give NBA teams some pause about his true upside. He's also incredibly right-hand dominant at this stage. And while a really effective defender collegiately, can he be a true NBA stopper against some of the league's top-shelf guards? For as good as he can be at the point of attack, he has had his struggles with quicker perimeter players, and has had his forgettable moments in terms of effort and ball screen navigation. He can also still evolve as an off ball defensive playmaker (1 block in 771 minutes) and rebounder. Comps at the next level (ceiling/floor): Lu Dort is a name you often hear linked to Keels given the football body and glimpses of defensive intensity. Dort was far more powerful and explosive at the same stage, while Keels is way ahead as a shooter, ball handler and passer. Sterling Brown is a realistic floor for Keels. While Brown was a four-year player at SMU and a mid-second-round pick, like Keels, he was a floor-spacing guard who played who had an inherent toughness and turned into a sound positional passer. If Keels were able to get himself into better shape and turn his shooting stroke into a real asset, Desmond Bane is a best-case prototype for him to model his game after.Optimal/practical NBA team fits: A team that values Keels' defensive toughness and isn't overly enamored with length, burst and explosiveness would be ideal for a player like Keels. The Milwaukee Bucks are an organization that comes to mind, especially with Pat Connaughton entering the last year of his contract, Donte DiVincenzo now in Sacramento and Wes Matthews a free agent. You can never have enough guards who can shoot, defend and pass around Giannis. The same goes for Luka Doncic, making Keels an intriguing fit there, especially with Jalen Brunson entering free agency. Simply put, playoff teams looking for a readymade role player -- Bucks, Dallas, Miami Heat, etc -- make a lot of sense for Keels.  -- Mike Schmitz ",NA,"March 28, 2022: (Final Four week mock draft) -- Keels has taken somewhat of a back seat to Duke's plethora of stars in the Blue Devils' Final Four run, especially with the reemergence of Jeremy Roach as the starting point guard and late-game offensive catalyst of wins over Michigan State and Texas Tech. With Roach struggling with the physicality and pressure of Arkansas' backcourt, Keels came in and completely turned the momentum, helping spur an important run with his defense and aggressiveness operating out of a ball screen, while draining a huge pull-up 3-pointer to end the first half and give Duke its biggest lead of the game.  On a team with five potential first-rounders (and another five star-recruit point guard in Roach), not every player will put up huge scoring numbers on any given night, which is why it was important for Keels to show he can impact the game in other ways and be ready to contribute when called upon. He was a team-high plus-17 against Arkansas, a strong indication of the contribution he made, showing the type of toughness and character NBA teams want to see from role players. At just 18 years of age, Keels has plenty to work on with his perimeter shooting and as a finisher, and there is a range of opinions among NBA scouts about how to view his upside. The word in NBA circles is Keels will likely strongly consider returning for his sophomore season if he doesn't receive assurances that he is a first-round lock. Continuing to play well in New Orleans next weekend would certainly help solidify his standing. -- Jonathan Givony March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Keels is a skilled two-way combo guard with a strong foundational skill set and the type of defensive toughness -- when fully engaged -- that NBA teams covet. Keels' early-season ball pressure, along with his strong frame, earned him comparisons to a guard such as Luguentz Dort. As the season has gone along, however, Keels' defensive motor has fluctuated wildly. The 18-year-old has as much riding on this NCAA tournament as any of the Duke prospects given the extreme highs and lows he has had this season.  When Keels is making shots and defending with energy, he looks like a potential lottery pick who could help an NBA team tomorrow, as he's capable of spot shooting, making the right reads in the pick-and-roll and pressuring the ball. Yet when his jumper isn't falling (32% from 3 on the season), his physical limitations, lack of length, issues finishing, defensive inconsistencies and sometimes erratic decision-making are more pronounced. Rediscovering his defensive toughness, finding a rhythm from 3 and determining the right blend between scoring and playmaking will go a long way in solidifying his status as a top-20 prospect. -- Mike Schmitz February 25, 2022: (Projecting Duke players) -- ","Keels was one of the last players to announce he was staying in the NBA draft instead of returning to lead new Duke coach Jon Scheyer to the Final Four in his first season at the helm. The 6-5 freshman is one of the youngest players in this draft class at just 18 years old. A two-way guard with a strong frame and a 6-7 wingspan, Keels is intriguing to NBA teams due to the combination of toughness, off-court intangibles, feel for the game, defensive versatility and passing creativity he shows. He showed a sense for the moment in some of Duke's biggest games last season, coming to life as a shot-maker and finisher around the basket in several crucial moments despite his age. Keels has plenty of work to do on his perimeter shooting and as a finisher around the basket, and there was a wide range of opinions among NBA scouts about exactly how to view his upside all season long. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Moussa Diabate",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Michigan","MICH",NA,NA,NA,"August 11, 2019: (U18 European Championship) -- Averaging 18 points, 18 rebounds and 3.5 blocks per 40 minutes, Diabate was one of the most productive players at this tournament at a relatively young age. Shooting under 50% from the field and 41% from the line, he didn't quite find a level of scoring efficiency, but part of that came from playing out of position at power forward on a French team that didn't have any real playmakers. Standing around 6-10, with a wiry frame, long arms and nice fluidity, Diabate was simply too mobile and quick off his feet for most big men at this level to handle. That translated especially on the offensive glass, where he demonstrated impressive instincts going out of his area frequently to the tune of 10 offensive boards per 40 minutes, the best rate at this event dating back to 2000. In other settings such as the Nike EYBL this spring, Diabate wasn't anywhere near as productive, so it will be interesting to see how this translates to higher levels of competition.  Diabate's ability to sprint the floor, catch everything thrown his way, finish around the rim and make plays with soft touch give him a nice framework long term. He showed some potential both protecting the rim and stepping out on the perimeter, getting in a deep stance and sliding his feet to cover ground. His body still has a long way to go to fully fill out and allow him to anchor a defense, and he could be more physical on both ends. Continuing to expand his shooting range out to the 3-point line will also be a major key. Diabate plays a bit of a tentative style at times, as he's still figuring out just who he is as a player. Based in the U.S. -- he recently moved to IMG Academy in Florida -- there is some talk in scouting circles that he may end up reclassifying to 2020, which could accelerate his NBA draft schedule. His frame, skill and feel for the game will all need to improve significantly to emerge as a legitimate one-and-done prospect, but he certainly helped his cause with a strong showing.  -- Jonathan Givony August 11, 2019: (Rising U16 prospects) -- Coming in with considerable hype, Diabate turned in an up-and-down tournament, shining for stretches thanks to his agility, motor, footwork, and ambidextrous finishes, yet not quite showing a clear-cut NBA role or skill level at this stage, posting a 46.6 true shooting percentage and 0.45 assist-to-turnover ratio. With big feet and a wiry frame, Diabate is at an early stage of his physical development which is reason for some optimism that he can continue to sprout and function more as a center (his best long-term position). Diabate is extremely coordinated and competitive as he runs the floor hard, attacks rebounds (15.9 per 40), plays above the rim in space and can sit down and switch on the perimeter. Following the Clint Capela mold is his best path to the NBA, as he doesn't stretch the floor a a shooter or offer much as a facilitator right now. However, he will have to become a much more adept rim protector. Overall, France was a bit dysfunctional offensively, and Diabate figures to shine with more savvy facilitators and shooters. Diabate, who is praised for his work ethic and intensity, is developing at Montverde and should continue to progress before entering the college ranks in 2021.  -- Mike Schmitz","A 6-10 center with a slender 217-pound frame, but a 7-2 1/2 wingspan and 9-1 1/2 standing reach, Diabate plays with tremendous energy and makes a major impact on the defensive end with the fluidity in which he covers ground. He's switchable on the perimeter, shows good instincts rotating to the rim, and plays with excellent spirit. Diabate's skill level, feel for the game and frame will need to improve to carve out an NBA career, but he just turned 20 years old and has minimal experience under his belt, giving him some upside to grow into. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Ryan Rollins",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Toledo","TOL",NA,NA,NA,"February 22, 2022: (Mock draft and Top 100 update) -- 19-year-old, 6-4 combo guard Ryan Rollins has played his way onto the NBA draft radar thanks to his breakout sophomore season with Toledo, as he ranks in the top-3 in the MAC in scoring (19.3) and win shares through 26 games. Only two under-20 players in the entire country are averaging at least 19 points per game: Rollins and future top-10 pick Johnny Davis. I recently made the trip out to Toledo to get an up-close evaluation of Rollins and learn more about one of the top mid-major prospects in the country.  Despite suiting up for heralded AAU program The Family, in high school, the Detroit native played second fiddle to eventual high-major prospects such as Isaiah Jackson, Jalen Terry, and Lorne Bowman, garnering mostly low- to mid-major offers before ultimately signing with Toledo. He also cited a broken wrist and hamstring injuries as reasons for his lack of recruitment and up-and-down prep career, which ultimately landed him in the Mid-American Conference, which also produced Ohio guard and Clippers rookie Jason Preston a season ago.  Now standing 6-4, 185 pounds with a 6-9 wingspan, Rollins is a smooth guard who can make shots off the dribble, change speeds effortlessly with tremendous footwork to put pressure on the rim and make the basic reads to suggest he could evolve into more of a consistent on-ball guard with more reps. He can create space with step-backs, rise up in mid-range, punish smaller guards on his way to the rim or the post, and make heady kick-out and drop-off passes, even if he's more wired to score than distribute. ""I'm a 3-level unselfish playmaker,"" said Rollins, who models his game after smooth guards including Devin Booker and CJ McCollum yet shares some physical similarities to Derrick White. ""I can do a lot of things on offense. I'm long, athletic. I'm a jack of all trades.""  We saw one of Rollins' worst games of the season from a productivity standpoint - 5 points on 10 shots in a narrow win over Central Michigan - but actually left encouraged by his talent and long-term potential. Calm, cool and collected on the court, his defensive intensity left much to be desired on film, both on and off the ball, but watching him battle through his offensive struggles to get defensive stops while making several smart reads showed he's more than capable on the defensive end of the floor when motivated. He has good feet, long arms and solid anticipation that has led to 1.8 steals per game in just under 33 minutes a night. Overall, Rollins looks like he's a year away from maximizing his draft stock as there's still room to grow with his shooting consistency (32.8% from 3), defensive intensity, and floor game (3.4 assists to 2.5 turnovers). Rollins will surely get no shortage of interest if he does opt to test the NBA draft waters, especially if he can help lead Toledo, which sits at first place in the MAC, to a conference tournament title and an NCAA tournament bid. With that said, if Toledo doesn't make the Big Dance and Rollins doesn't have an opportunity to prove himself against more high-major opponents, he'll be firmly in the first-round mix in 2023 if he returns for his junior season, develops into a 40-percent 3-point shooter, gains more experience as the primary ball handler, and finds more consistency on the defensive end.  - Mike Schmitz ","ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the Hawks traded the No. 44 pick to the Warriors for the No. 51 pick and $2 million.  Rollins is a smooth, skilled and instinctual scorer with wide shoulders and a huge 6-foot-10 wingspan who emerged on NBA radars with an excellent sophomore season at Toledo. Rollins has quite a bit of talent with the ball in his hands, getting to his spots with the ability to change speeds fluidly and a polished mid-range arsenal. Still developing the strength and willingness to play through contact and make good decisions consistently, he shows the ability to make intelligent reads out of ball-screens and could develop into more of a primary ball handler down the road. Defensively, Rollins lacks intensity and physicality in a major way, weighing just 179 pounds, but still demonstrates some instincts as a playmaker when engaged. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"ESPN","Ismael  Kamagate",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Paris","Paris",NA,NA,NA,"January 26, 2022: (Top 100) -- French center Ismael Kamagate (No. 32) has quickly emerged as the top international big man prospect in this 2022 class, opening eyes with his Jarrett Allen-like poster dunks and flashes of skill. After seeing Kamagate practice and conducting a film session with him our last time abroad in October, we were able to watch the 6-11, 21-year-old play a France Pro A (first division) game against the top team in the league, Levallois, which also competes in the EuroCup. Watching Kamagate go through an individual workout pre-game, it's easy to see the long-term intrigue given his huge hands, massive reach, ability to handle the ball and natural touch, splashing step-back mid-range jumpers with ease. He looks like he's dunking on a Nerf hoop in warmups, which he also translated to live action with a poster dunk in the second half. Kamagate has dunked on several players over several victims this season, and is one of the draft's best finishers, converting 72.4% of his shots at the rim. He's a jet in the open court when he decides to run hard, and in addition to the rim runs and hard rolls, he's also comfortable using touch shots or creating off the bounce in short roll situations. As has been the case at times throughout his career, however, Kamagate struggled with early foul trouble against Levallois. He's still very much learning how to defend pick-and-roll effectively and isn't the forceful rim protector that his reach and bounce suggest. Too often lost off the ball and not the most physical defensive rebounder, Kamagate is a couple years away from being able to consistently impact a game defensively at the NBA level, even though he's blocking 2.4 shots per 40 minutes and is relatively quick off the floor for his size. With that said, the fact that Kamagate shows more flashes of skill than the majority of run-and-jump style bigs is what makes him the most intriguing international big man in this class. Despite often playing without a true point guard and alongside more traditional bigs, Kamagate has made a handful of eye-opening passes this season, firing overhead skips to the corner out of the short roll, hitting cutters with one-handed passes, or locating weakside shooters off a live dribble out of the post. He's starting to take more mid-range jumpers also, and, although flat, his stroke has potential (70% from the free-throw line). A true late-bloomer who wasn't even considered for youth national teams not too long ago, Kamagate's growth rate is staggering, and his capacity to learn is noteworthy, despite being older than several of the bigs ranked behind him. Kamagate might not be a carbon copy of Allen or Clint Capela like his go-go-gadget dunks suggest, but there's a clear archetype for some of the things he does well (see Daniel Gafford, Richaun Holmes) and because he can handle, pass and maybe shoot down the line, it's hard to get a perfect gauge on what exactly his upside might be. I'd expect Kamagate to start picking up more steam among scouting circles, getting real looks toward the end of the first round come June. -- Mike Schmitz October 12, 2021: (Top 100) -- The international prospect making the most noise is Kamagate, a bouncy 6-11 French center (with roots on the Ivory Coast, from which his parents are natives) on a rapid trajectory that should earn him looks throughout the second round -- and potentially the first -- if he keeps producing like he has. Through three France Pro A games alongside Celtics stash Juhann Begarin, Kamagate is averaging 11 points, 6 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 3.3 blocks in 29.1 minutes, most recently registering an 18-point, 9-block game last Saturday. For reference, Capela averaged 9.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, 0.8 steals and 1.5 blocks in 21.6 minutes per game over 33 Pro A contests during his draft-eligible year (at age 19) and was ultimately selected 25th.  We spent the day with Kamagate in Paris to watch him practice, break down film, and learn more about his path from end of the bench youth player to NBA prospect. Kamagate looks the part physically standing 6-11, 227 pounds with a 7-3 wingspan and a 9-0 reach, giving him solid measurements for an NBA center, especially when you consider his late-blooming status. While not quite as long as Capela, his physical profile isn't far off as Capela measured 6-11, 222 pounds and a 7-4.5 wingspan at the 2014 Nike Hoop Summit. Kamagate is incredibly agile for his size with great hands, soft touch, and an improving passing feel that he showed off at the U20 European Championships this summer. His offensive confidence and defensive motor fluctuate far more than scouts would hope, but when Kamagate is playing with consistent belief, he's an effective lob-catcher, offensive rebounder, switch defender, and rim protector. Improving on the defensive glass remains a priority for Kamagate. With Victor Wembanyama just a two-hour train ride away in Lyon, expect NBA scouts and executives to dig in extensively on Kamagate as he's in an excellent opportunity to showcase his growth with consistent playing time at his disposal. -- Mike Schmitz","ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the Trail Blazers traded the No. 46 pick to the Nuggets.  A long, bouncy, late-blooming big man who had an outstanding season in the French first division of the LNB Pro A after an equally productive showing at the FIBA U20 European Championship, Kamagate has been on a major upward trajectory for several years now. He blossomed in Pro A France as a lob-catching roll man, while showing the ability to make tough shots in the paint. He also had some impressive moments as a shot-blocker and passer, but has room to be more consistent from game to game and find more physicality with his approach. Kamagate's skill level is much-improved, but he still looks mechanical at times on both ends, with a confidence level that comes and goes at times. He's in an excellent situation at Paris and could very well be stashed there for another year, potentially forming a twin-tower lineup with potential 2023 No. 1 pick Victor Wembanyama. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They did it almost exclusively with the highly regarded freshman Brown glued to the bench. Brown's offensive weaknesses were put on full display by North Carolina's game plan, which was to ignore him on the perimeter and dare him to take open jump shots, which Brown happily did, going 0-for-4 from 3. Brown's shaky ball-handling ability and feel for the game were also put to the test, as well as his lack of awareness and physicality defensively. Brown was repeatedly late rotating in both the half court and transition while getting beaten up on the glass and fighting over screens, as the game simply moved too fast for him at times. Baylor's coaching staff finally pulled the plug with 13 minutes left, and the team then went on a huge run when UNC forward Brady Manek was ejected on a highly questionable call, leading Brown to finish minus-23.  Not turning 19 until May, Brown's raw offensive skill set and struggles defensively aren't shocking considering his lack of experience, and he still has several intriguing attributes to hang his hat on as arguably the most explosive leaper in this draft class, with a 6-11 wingspan and some real flashes of passing and ability to defend one-on-one. Still, there are real question marks about what exactly Brown's role will be early in his NBA career, and whether he has the touch to develop his jump shot, which will be a major key to his long-term development. -- Jonathan Givony March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- The most explosive leaper in college, Brown is a highlight reel waiting to happen anytime he catches the ball with room to operate. The flashes he shows as a passer and a multipositional defender on the perimeter are intriguing for a 6-foot-8 18-year-old, even if his ballhandling and perimeter shooting still have a ways to go to play on the wing full time and his frame is a little thin for a power forward. Brown's productivity has really fluctuated against better competition, which makes sense considering his limitations in the skill department. NBA teams will be intrigued by his physical profile, age and long-term upside, but avoiding some of the lapses defensively that have plagued him at times and finishing the season on a good note will certainly help his cause.-- Jonathan Givony November 30, 2021: (Top 100) -- No player in our top-100 has been more efficient than Brown so far this season. The freshman ranks 1st in that group in true shooting percentage while possessing the physical profile, quickness, speed and leaping ability NBA teams look for in a wing, emerging as a first-round-caliber prospect in the process.  Having now seen Brown both in a practice setting and in the Battle 4 Atlantis, his elasticity as an athlete really pops, especially off of two feet. With measurables similar to a young Andrew Wiggins at 6-8, 205 with a 6-11 wingspan, Brown is incredibly quick off the floor, can stop and start instantaneously and is a nightmare for opposing defenses in transition when he opts to get out and run with his blazing open-court speed. Brown has done a nice job of keeping it simple offensively through seven games, moving the ball and staying active as a cutter, while showcasing more passing feel (3.7 assists per 40 minutes) than scouts anticipated. Brown's clear swing skill is his shooting. He doesn't have the most fluid stroke -- with mechanics similar to Matisse Thybulle -- and has a tendency to shy away from open looks or not stay spaced to the corner. He's attempted just 6 triples in 171 minutes so far, but Brown has connected on 4 of the 6, is making 71% of his free throws and has soft touch on his floater. With over 43% of his offense coming in transition and possessing a low usage rate, scouts will have a close eye on how Brown's shooting, ball handling and passing look against set defenses throughout the season, as that will go a long way in determining his NBA upside. But in the interim, the fact that he's been able to score the ball efficiently without much volume and make heady reads in space bodes well for his draft stock. Defensively, Brown has the quickness and length to be a highly impactful on- and off-ball defender. He's rangy with solid all-around instincts, which have allowed him to collect 2.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per 40 minutes thus far. Very quiet on the floor, Brown isn't the type of demonstrative personality we see from a lot of elite wing defenders, and he's likely better defending 1 through 3 than true combo forward types given his frame. But Brown has all the ingredients to be a high-level NBA defender for years to come. With the NBA starved for rangy wings who can guard and potentially make a shot, the 18-year-old Brown will have plenty of interest league-wide, especially because he's likely to grade out well analytically thanks to his combination of youth, efficiency and production. -- Mike Schmitz","ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the Timberwolves traded the No. 48 pick to the Pacers.  The most explosive leaper in college basketball, Brown is a highlight reel waiting to happen anytime he catches the ball with room to operate. The flashes he shows as a passer and multi-positional defender on the perimeter are intriguing at 6-7 1/2 and 19 years old with a 6-11 wingspan, even if his ballhandling and perimeter shooting still needs developing to play on the wing full-time as his 201-pound frame is a little thin for power forward. Brown's productivity fluctuated against better competition this season, which makes sense considering his limitations in the skill department. NBA teams were intrigued by his physical profile, age and long-term upside, but improving his skill level and avoiding some of the lapses defensively that have plagued him at times this past season will help his chances of carving out a meaningful niche in the NBA. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"ESPN","Matteo  Spagnolo",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cremona","Cremona",NA,NA,NA,"January 26, 2022: (Top 100) -- Few international prospects have improved their respective draft stock more than 19-year-old Italian Matteo Spagnolo (No. 43), who is in the midst of a breakout season with Cremona in the Italian first division and is in the running for the best European lead guard in this class. On loan from Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid, Spagnolo is one of only five teenagers in all of high-level Europe playing at least 25 minutes per game, leading that group in scoring (12.0 PPG) and 3-point percentage (48.6%). We evaluated Spagnolo during a home game against Sassari and conducted an hour-long film session with him after, getting a better feel for how he sees the game and his approach, which coaches and evaluators have long raved about. In his first real professional season, Spagnolo has dazzled with his off-the-dribble shooting, creativity in pick-and-roll and flashes of ball screen brilliance. More comfortable with his patented crossover, mid-range pull-up than long-range 3s coming into this season, Spagnolo is starting to knock down step-back triples with more regularity, even pulling from NBA range with teams darting under screens. Calm and even keel on the floor, he's able to use his 6-5, 198-pound frame to keep his defender on his hip before making an off-the-dribble pass to an open teammate or re-accelerating to the rim into a finesse finish. Although more wired to score than facilitate, he snakes ball screens like a veteran, crediting hours studying guards such as Luka Doncic, Milos Teodosic and Trae Young, while picking up little things from practicing with Facundo Campazzo during his time in Madrid. Like many of the aforementioned guards, he's not afraid to try and fit passes into tight windows or take big shots down the stretch of important games, which have been key traits for successful international guards before him. Italy isn't known as the most athletic league, however, and Spagnolo's finishing struggles (46% at the rim) and lack of blow-by speed figure to be even more pronounced as the level of competition rises. Cremona is also toward the bottom of the Italian League standings, fighting to avoid relegation to the second division, so his production does come with a caveat. Spagnolo has a long way to go on the defensive end of the floor, as he doesn't always play with the necessary energy and discipline to overcome his average foot speed and limited overall range, both on and off the ball. >But, like we saw with Lithuanian guard Rokas Jokubaitis last draft (No. 34 to the New York Knicks), there's clear draft-and-stash value in an international guard with positional size, shooting touch, creativity, feel and confidence. With Spagnolo under contract with Real Madrid for two additional seasons, whoever drafts him wouldn't have to use a roster spot on the Brindisi native until he's almost 22 years old, giving him the time and in-game reps to continue improving as a defender, finisher, and spot-up shooter (he's made only three catch-and-shoot jumpers all season). Should Spagnolo make a run at the NBA as a 21-year-old, there's a better chance he'd be able to have an Austin Reaves type of impact as a rookie. Spagnolo -- an Italian national team mainstay -- has firmly planted himself on the NBA radar this season, and will remain a player team executives study closely as he continues to produce in Italy. -- Mike Schmitz","Spagnolo had a highly productive season competing at a strong level in the Italian first division. He shows a maturity and skill level that immediately put him on NBA radars as a 19-year-old, 6-5 point guard. Operating extensively out of ball screens, he showed a knack for making intelligent reads out of pick and rolls, be it operating in mid-range spots, dishing off a live dribble, and perhaps most importantly, pulling up from beyond the arc, where he shot 44% for 3 this season. Not blessed with blow-by quickness and struggling at times to contain the ball defensively, his ability to make the leap physically to the NBA is a question mark, and will likely require additional time spent polishing his game at the highest levels in Europe first. With two more years on his contract with Real Madrid, but a loan to a lower-level also possible next year, Spagnolo's flexible stash situation made him an attractive option at this spot in the draft. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The versatile wing shot 43% from 3 last season at UConn and was regularly tasked with defending the opposing team's best perimeter player. He was able to show a little more vision and creativity as a passer in the pre-draft process, plus glimpses of on-the-move shot-making, as well as his ability to fill lanes aggressively and finish in the open court.  At 199 pounds with a 6-8 wingspan and average explosiveness, Martin doesn't have elite physical tools defensively, nor is he the most gifted ball handler or overall scorer. But hard-nosed wing-players in his mold who can defend multiple positions, rebound and make shots consistently (although teams will scrutinize his 67% career free-throw percentage) aren't that easy to come by, making him a likely candidate for a two-way contract after hearing his name called.

Matkovic was one such prospect -- despite being ranked in ESPN's 2022 draft Top 100 all season, and being teammates with projected first-rounder Nikola Jovic, he wasn't taken very seriously as a legit draft option until an explosive showing in Chicago. Matkovic was one of the bounciest big men we saw all week on the pro day circuit, regularly putting his head on the rim and surprisingly showing a very natural stroke and impressive shot-making prowess considering he's attempted only six total 3s in his 137-game career, according to the DraftExpress database.  Matkovic's energy on the floor was infectious, and it was clear that his American workout partners gravitated to him and were having a great deal of fun witnessing his introduction to the larger NBA world in Chicago. Matkovic's agency says it has quite a few workout requests following the pro day, more requests than available dates at this point. There's a much better chance of Matkovic hearing his name called on draft night now than existed last week, but he also has the ability to withdraw his name on June 13 and try to ride his momentum into an even more favorable position next year. -- Jonathan Givony","Playing alongside Nikola Jovic in Serbia this season, Matkovic didn't fully catch the attention of NBA teams until a strong pre-draft process in which he showcased his outstanding explosiveness, natural shooting stroke and infectious energy level, drawing comparisons to players like Drew Eubanks in the process. It's difficult to understand why Matkovic -- a 71% free-throw shooter this season -- has only attempted six 3-pointers in his 137-game career, but that will have to change if he's to carve out a real career in the NBA. His 7-1 wingspan isn't ideal for a player projected to play center, but he does display nice versatility defensively with the intensity he displays, the way he covers ground and the quickness in which he gets off his feet. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","JD Davison",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alabama","ALA",NA,NA,NA," March 15, 2022: (2022 NBA mock draft: Drafting players competing in the NCAA tournament) -- Davison entered the college game known as a YouTube sensation thanks to his explosive dunking ability, but quickly showed there's more to his game, showing impressive feel as a passer and real grit defensively. He has an excellent physical profile for a guard, which has allowed him to play on and off the ball for Alabama, who has beaten some of the best teams in college while racking up plenty of confusing losses. Offense has been a major struggle at times for Davison, who isn't a polished ball-handler or a consistent shooter. It's clear that Davison's struggles as a scorer and concerningly high turnover rate make him more of a long-term prospect, which has allowed more productive guards to jump ahead of him as the season has moved on. Finishing on a strong note will be important considering the way Davison's productivity has fluctuated, something that may make returning for another season in college appealing (or necessary) depending on how his season ends. -- Jonathan Givony March 9, 2022: (Stock Watch) -- Alabama has been one of the more confusing teams in college basketball this season, posting wins over several Final Four contenders such as Gonzaga, Baylor, Houston, Tennessee, LSU, Arkansas, while losing to the likes of Missouri, Georgia, Iona, Davidson, and Texas A&M.  Davison has been equally inconsistent, alternating between starting, coming off the bench and playing a limited role at different points in the season, while posting scintillating performances at times or going scoreless in others. Freshmen like Davison, who hails from the small town of Letohatchee, Alabama, and played at a very low level in high school were particularly hurt by the opportunities eliminated by the pandemic, at least from an experience standpoint. Davison's 28% turnover percentage will be the highest of any player drafted in the past decade, as being thrown straight into the gauntlet of SEC defenses has been a definite learning experience. Offense has been somewhat of a challenge for Davison, whose 12.7 points per-40 is the second-lowest of any college player currently projected to be drafted. His ball-handling ability is a major work in progress, as he's struggled considerably to generate efficient shots for himself in pick and roll and one on one situations this season, clearly not looking ready to be a primary creator at this level of competition. That's compounded by Davison's struggles shooting off the dribble, as he's hit just 24% (8-for-34) of his pull-up jumpers this season according to Synergy Sports Technology. Davison has had plenty of outstanding moments this season that hint at great things to come down the road for a team willing to be patient with his development. He's a highly unselfish, creative passer who uses his size effectively to pick apart defenses driving and dishing in a variety of situations, but especially in the open court. He's one of the best rebounding guards in this draft and regularly busts out off the defensive glass and finds teammates off a live dribble. There aren't many guards in the college game who show the flashes he does changing gears out of hesitation moves, absorbing contact in the lane and finishing explosively at the rim, something that can hopefully be developed further in time.  Playing alongside two ball-dominant, upperclassmen guards in Jahvon Quinerly and Jaden Shackelford, Davison has been forced to take a backseat and play on the wing much more than he likely expected, which has allowed him to show some better-than-expected ability to hit spot-up jumpers, converting 37% of his attempts on the season with his feet set.  Defensively, Davison checks anyone from point guard to power forwards in Alabama's switch-heavy scheme, bringing a level of physicality the team has sorely lacked at times this season, while proving to be a real playmaker by getting in passing lanes, blocking jump-shots and crashing the glass effectively. He's far from perfect on this end of the floor, at times getting caught losing his focus or flat-footed off the ball, but has been able to stay on the floor through his offensive struggles in no small part due to the versatility and effectiveness he brings here. Davison's standing has dropped somewhat relative to where he started the season as more productive college guards have eclipsed him. A strong finish to the season, starting in the SEC tournament, which will be packed with NBA talent evaluators, and then the NCAA tournament, would certainly help. Taking the Jaden Ivey route, a player he's at times compared to by NBA executives, could have some merit. The Purdue guard was considered a potential late first-round pick at the end of his freshman season but is now likely to be picked in the top-5 after a breakout sophomore season. There are advantages to both strategies and Davison will have a decision to make in the next month or so on which route he'll elect to take. -- Mike Schmitz December 22, 2021: (Mock Draft) -- Even though he comes off the bench for a strong Alabama squad, the point guard has looked the part of a potential lottery pick. Over his past five contests, he's posted averages of 11 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.2 steals in just 25.4 minutes while shooting 61% from 2 and 42% from 3.  I evaluated Davison in person earlier this month during his 20-point explosion in a win over Gonzaga and his 10-assist night in a loss to Memphis. I also sat down in Memphis with the 19-year-old to break down his film. While his high-flying dunks helped him become an RSCI top-15 prospect in his high school class, Davison's passing has been a revelation this season. He's a one-man fast break with the ability to spray the ball to shooters, even off a live dribble. He can diagnose pick-and-roll coverages, hitting the roll player in stride or making corner skips. On top of the passing, he's done a great job making what head coach Nate Oats calls ""blue collar plays."" He's an elite rebounder for a guard who hammered home the game-winning tip dunk against Houston. He's still improving his defensive discipline and off-ball consistency, but the tools, instincts and anticipation are there to become a plus defender in the NBA. Now it's about Davison evolving as a ballhandler and a more dynamic pull-up shooter -- he's made just two pull-up jumpers in 271 minutes. Teams have darted under screens, daring him to punish them from 3, which he's not willing to do and limits him as a half-court scorer. His spot-up 3 is ahead of where scouts expected and part of the lack of pull-ups is by design, as Alabama doesn't shoot midrange jumpers, emphasizing 3s and layups. But adding a consistent pull-up 3 will help steer comparisons closer toward Tyrese Maxey as opposed to Elfrid Payton. Overall, Davison has made his case that he belongs in the conversation as the best non-Jaden Ivey guard in the draft, and the fact that he plays a key role on an Alabama team with the potential for a deep run into March bodes well for his draft stock. -- Mike Schmitz","Davison entered the college game known as a YouTube sensation thanks to his explosive dunking ability. He also demonstrated there's more to his game, showing some feel as a passer and a willingness to mix things up defensively. He has a solid physical profile for a guard, which allowed him to play on and off the ball for Alabama, who had a very inconsistent season. Offense was a major struggle at times for Davison, who isn't a polished ball handler or a consistent shooter, and turned the ball over at an alarmingly high rate. It's clear that Davison's struggles as a scorer and decision-maker make him more of a long-term prospect, which allowed more productive guards to jump ahead of him as the season moved on and on draft night. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Yannick Nzosa",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Unicaja Malaga","Unicaja Malaga",NA,NA,NA,"February 14, 2022: (Top 100) -- After putting together an excellent debut season in the ACB last year, Nzosa quickly fell out of favor with NBA scouts and executives, as he struggled to build on his 2020-21 campaign, regressing in an inconsistent role with Unicaja Malaga in Spain. Although he's been a big name in scouting circles for some time, most decision makers have yet to get a real in-depth look at the 6-11 rangy big man as he missed five months due to a groin injury in the offseason and Malaga practices were closed to NBA scouts early in the year.  On top of that, Nzosa's play in October-1.6 points, 2.0 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in 12.4 minutes over 7 games on 26.7% shooting - didn't exactly generate the type of intrigue that would lead scouts to make him a priority on their often-complex international scouting schedules. Nzosa played well when I saw him live at Murcia, blocking four shots in 18 minutes and showcasing the type of energy NBA teams look for in a run-and-jump big. It's been a roller coaster ride since then, however, with Nzosa's finishing taking a nosedive from 64% last year to 48% this season, raising legitimate questions about his hands, touch, and thin frame. While coaches and teammates have always raved about his intangibles -- which we saw first-hand when we sat down with him in Malaga -- scouts have also long questioned the legitimacy of his age (18.2 years old), and his sudden departure from Italian Academy Stella Azurra to Unicaja Malaga raised even more questions about Nzosa's path. Even with the in-game struggles and question marks, Nzosa is one of the fastest 6-11 players on the planet and still has his fair share of eye-opening moments covering ground defensively for blocks at the rim -- Nzosa ranks 4th in the ACB in blocks per 40 minutes and 5th in block percentage. Since 2000 Nzosa is one of only five under-22 players to post a block percentage over 7%, joining names like Bismack Biyombo, Walter Tavares and Lucas Noguiera. While the 25-game sample this season suggests we have a pretty good sense of the type of prospect Nzosa is, the glimpses he showed last year makes you wonder if there's ultimately ""buy-low"" potential with the prospect once viewed by some as a first rounder. Which version is the real Nzosa? The ACB All Rising Star Team member who can change games with his defensive versatility, energy and vertical spacing or the foul-prone, thin center who struggles to process complex actions, has issues catching and finishing in traffic, puts too much pressure on himself, and gets beat up on the glass? How much did Nzosa's five-month absence slow his progress? Would he look better on an NBA floor in a Nic Claxton type of role alongside skill players? Nzosa's extreme peaks and valleys along with the fact that top executives haven't seen him at his best makes him one of the more mysterious prospects in the draft. -- Mike Schmitz October 12, 2021: (Top 100) -- ESPN traveled to Murcia, Spain, to evaluate the potential lottery pick. Nzosa is a speedy 6-11 big man who cemented himself on the NBA radar with his surprise productivity in the ACB and EuroCup for Malaga as a teenager last season. After missing five months with a groin injury, the Democratic Republic of Congo native is off to a slow start for Unicaja Malaga, shooting just 7-of-22 from the field through six games after converting 64% of his shots through 39 games a season ago.  Even though he's still working through some rust on the offensive end, Nzosa showed exactly the type of game-changing defender he can be in the NBA during an 18-minute, four-block performance in a come-from-behind win over Murcia. At close to 6-11 in shoes with a 7-4 wingspan, Nzosa covers an incredible amount of ground defensively, challenging shots at the rim with verticality, sprinting the floor for chasedown blocks and suffocating guards on the perimeter as a switch defender. While his defensive discipline could still use work, Nzosa plays with tremendous energy and is the type of live body who can barely sit still on the bench. He can switch, hang with perimeter players, and change shots around the rim, but to fully maximize his defensive potential he'll have to continue getting stronger, as he's quite lean with a wiry 208-pound frame that would remind you of young bigs like Nerlens Noel, Isaiah Jackson, Anthony Randolph, Nic Claxton, among others. Offensively, Nzosa is at his best sprinting the floor -- which he does better than any big-man prospect I've ever evaluated with rare speed and the ability to even shift gears while in full stride. He's a lob threat in the half court, an active offensive rebounder, and capable of getting from the 3 to the front of the rim for a dunk in one dribble. Nzosa will have to continue improving his screening angles, shaky hands, ball handling, decision-making and touch around the rim to fully utilize his physical tools as a diver and slasher -- he's scoring just 8.5 points per 40 minutes right now. The 17-year-old Nzosa, who speaks five languages but has been playing basketball only since age 13, might not be the potential top-5 pick he was once touted as, but the way he moves on the floor is incredibly unique. And that combined with his high energy, infectious personality and the need for switch-heavy, vertical-spacing bigs in the NBA in the Clint Capela mold, bodes well for him as long as he starts to get more comfortable on the offensive end as the season progresses. -- Mike Schmitz April 20, 2021: (2022 Mock Draft) -- Yannick Nzosa has taken off in a major way while seeing significant playing time in the Spanish ACB and EuroCup for Unicaja Malaga. Nzosa's offensive game -- including his ability to make jump shots, finish out of pick-and-rolls, pass out of short-roll situations, push off the defensive glass and create his own offense in the half court -- is improving by leaps and bounds seemingly every game. He ranks as the third-best shot-blocker in the ACB on a per-minute basis, and is drawing rave reviews for his approach to the game and maturity on and off the court by everyone he encounters. Nzosa, who has seen plenty of crunch-time minutes in important games for Malaga the past few months, has been recruited by former NBA player Jorge Garbajosa of the Spanish Basketball Federation to receive a Spanish passport, which would allow him to become a member of the national team, similar to Nikola Mirotic and Serge Ibaka. While his frame has plenty of room for improvement, and his overall polish on both ends of the floor is still a work in progress, Nzosa looks like a strong candidate to continue his upward trajectory and have a breakout season next year. -- Jonathan Givony December 29, 2020: (Breakout candidates for 2022) -- The youngest player in the 2022 mock draft, Nzosa has been testing himself against the highest level of competition of any player in the class, carving out a rotation role in the Spanish ACB and EuroCup with Unicaja Malaga.  Starting his very first pro game of the season, the Congolese player became just the third 16-year-old (Luka Doncic, Ricky Rubio) in ACB history to score in double figures back in September, and then Nzosa matched that feat again a week later. His minutes and role have fluctuated as the season has progressed, but Nzosa has dropped impressive glimpses of talent every time he has stepped onto the floor, rarely looking out of place. Averaging 2.5 steals and 2.5 blocks per 40 minutes, Nzosa is a game-changer defensively -- even at the highest levels of European basketball -- giving his team a lift with his energy and skills every time he steps on the court. He covers ground exceptionally with outstanding mobility, regularly hedging pick-and-rolls well past the 3-point line and then recovering back to the paint with terrifying closing speed. He gets off the floor quickly and has stellar ability as a rim protector to go along with a huge standing reach. Offensively, Nzosa does not have a particularly high skill level or the frame to bang consistently with grown men, but he is finding ways to contribute regardless by beating opposing centers down the floor in transition, crashing the offensive glass and finishing pick-and-rolls. He has reliable hands, the ability to finish with soft touch using both hands and good shooting mechanics from the free throw line. Only weighing about 215 pounds, Nzosa's frame is the biggest thing he'll have to work on long term. His lack of strength is an issue in guarding the post and crashing the defensive glass, as he gets moved around relatively easily. As his career moves on, scouts will want to see Nzosa continue to improve his skill level and potentially show some range on his jump shot. For now, the fact that he is playing and contributing at this level is impressive enough. -- Jonathan Givony ","Nzosa started this season projected as a lottery pick after an extremely impressive 2020-21 season as a 17-year-old who made a major impact in the ACB, but regressed in a highly disappointing fashion this year as his numbers plummeted in every category. Nzosa still has two major things working in his favor: He is incredibly agile for a player with a 7-4 wingspan and possesses outstanding defensive potential as a switchable center who can slide his feet on the perimeter, protect the rim and even chase down blocks in transition. Offensively, Nzosa is very limited at this stage, both because of his weak frame but also due to his poor hands and low skill level. The second-youngest player drafted in this class, the rave reviews Nzosa draws for his work ethic off the court and outstanding energy level made him interesting enough to warrant a draft pick despite how far away he looked from playing in a serious NBA game this year. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Gui  Santos",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Minas","Minas",NA,NA,NA,"April 21, 2021: (Santos update) -- Brazilian forward Gui Santos has submitted paperwork to the league office to make himself eligible for the 2021 NBA draft, his agent Aylton Tesch of A11 Sports Management told ESPN. Santos, the No. 33 prospect in the ESPN 2022 mock draft, is having a productive season as a starter in the Brazilian first division for Minas Tenis Clube, which is in second place with a 26-4 record. The 6-foot-8, 18-year-old forward is averaging 8.5 points, 5.7 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game, shooting 37% on 3-pointers. He was one of 13 players invited to the Nike Hoop Summit World Team earlier this month, a prestigious honor. He put himself on the NBA radar at the NBA's Basketball Without Borders Americas camp in 2019. He was also a key member of the Brazilian senior national team lineup in the FIBA Americup Qualifiers window in November and was expected to do the same in the February FIBA window before Brazil's games were postponed due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Because of his youth and the lack of scouting opportunities caused by the pandemic, Santos was not originally expected to be a part of the 2021 NBA draft class. Positive feedback from teams and the removal of NBA travel restrictions for scouting purposes led him to enter the draft to evaluate his chances of hearing his name called, his agent said. The Brazilian playoffs will start this week, and Minas will attempt to win its first league championship in club history. Powerfully built, with a 7-foot wingspan that allows him to play bigger than his height, Santos sees time at both forward spots, being asked to do a little bit of everything for the Belo Horizonte-based team thanks to his versatile skill set and ability to defend multiple positions. He's often tasked with bringing the ball up and getting his team into its offense, seeing quite a few possessions initiating pick-and-roll sets or attacking mismatches one-on-one. The freedom he enjoys offensively and the opportunity he's received this season is somewhat of a rarity at this level of competition, as he gets significant playing time in both the Brazilian league and the Basketball Champions League Americas, a pan-continental league for the top teams in South America in which his team finished in third place.  -- Jonathan Givony","A long-armed, strong-framed wing who made significant improvements the past two seasons in Brazil, Santos possesses a nice blend of versatility, fluidity and physicality attacking the rim, while consistently competing defensively and on the glass. Santos is not yet consistent enough as a shooter and is still working to develop into a more well-rounded all-around scorer. He handled the ball more this season and showed strides with his passing ability. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"ESPN","Hugo Besson",2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NZ Breakers","NZ Breakers",NA,NA,NA,"April 29, 2021: (Intriguing long-term prospects) -- While we saw Besson's worst game of the season from a productivity standpoint (5 point on 9 shots in 30 minutes), he still caught my eye with his improved floor game, confidence and competitiveness as a 6-4 combo guard who can score it at all 3 levels. Besson has been a revelation this season in his first full year at the pro level. He ranks second in all of France's second division in scoring at 16.9 points in just 28.4 minutes while shooting 60% from 2 and 35% from 3 and moonlighting as a point guard for stretches, averaging 3.9 assists per 40 minutes.  He topped 25 points in four games this season, most recently dropping 27 on Blois while knocking down 6-of-9 3s. Although on the streaky side when sprinting off screens, he's shown the ability to shoot the ball on the move, is capable of pulling up off the bounce, and is converting a remarkable 67% of his shots at the rim, impressive when you consider his average physical profile at 6-4, 196 pounds. Often earning comparisons to Nando De Colo in France, Besson's ability to play on or off the ball and go for 20 on any given night should make him attractive to NBA teams as he climbs up the ranks in Europe. He still needs to improve as a defender, turn himself into a knockdown shooter, and take his ball screen reads to the next level. But with the success of microwave scorers ranging from Tyler Herro to Jordan Clarkson in today's NBA, scouts would be wise to get familiar with Besson because of his confident shot-making ability and rapidly improving game at just 20 years old. Still unknown to most scouts as he was never invited to the French junior national team, Besson's peak draft stock should come in 2022, especially since he's garnering interest from clubs all over Europe and beyond for next season.  -- Mike Schmitz","A microwave scorer who moved to the Australian NBL after a big year in the French second division, Besson is a third-generation pro with confidence and scoring instincts for days. Standing nearly 6-6 in shoes, he's a prolific shot-maker who scores in bunches by pulling up off the dribble or operating off sharp stepbacks from well beyond the 3-point line. Besson also shows the ability to create shots skillfully inside the arc as well, often to dish off a live dribble to teammates in highlight-reel fashion. Just an average finisher at the rim due to his narrow frame and just-decent explosiveness, Besson's negative wingspan and general struggles on the defensive end are the biggest issues he'll have to work through to carve out a long-term NBA career. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Victor Wembanyama",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"France","France",NA,NA,NA,"Nov. 7, 2022 Wembanyamania hit its peak with a pair of exhilarating October performances against the Ignite. The 7-foot-4 super prospect posted 73 points in 70 minutes with a breathtaking display of shot-making, ballhandling, shot-blocking and passing unlike anything we've ever seen before. Wembanyama hasn't missed a beat since returning to France. He is producing steadily, as his Metropolitans 92 team has won four straight games (6-1 overall) and is second in the LNB Pro A, proving his extraordinary talent translates to winning, something that is rare for an 18-year-old at this level of competition. Wembanyama isn't only leading his team, he is emerging as the most productive player in the entire league, ranking second in scoring, third in rebounding, first in blocks and fifth in usage rate. Unsurprisingly, Wembanyama is playing a different style of basketball in France than what scouts saw against the Ignite in Las Vegas, something his coach, Vincent Collet, said is expected considering the shorter 3-point line and increased physicality of the European game. ""Defense is different [in the United States],"" Collet said. ""He has more room in the G League game. And probably the referees are protecting more. Sometimes they grab him in France [making a bear hug motion with arms]. So that's something special that didn't happen [in Las Vegas]. I don't think he has to play to make seven 3s each game."" Towering over opponents, we've seen Wembanyama look more assertive, utilizing his size and physicality operating with his back to the basket, where he shows an extremely high skill level and is big enough to simply shoot over virtually any defender with unstoppable turnaround jumpers. While Wembanyama's perimeter shooting, fluidity pushing off the defensive glass and handling in pick-and-roll and isolation situations generate some of his most notable highlights, the footwork, fluidity, dexterity and touch he shows in the post also is encouraging considering his propensity to shy away from contact in the past. Wembanyama still drops glimpses of the same incredible talent he displayed in Las Vegas, having the freedom to push the ball the length of the floor, reject ball screens or shoot coming off pindowns or one-legged jumpers -- things that are unheard of and simply mesmerizing for a player his size. He hasn't been quite as consistent with his outside shot -- 11-for-33 from 3 in France as compared to 9-for-18 against the Ignite -- but part of that is due to difficult attempts, the amount of defensive attention he draws every game and some regression to the mean after a scorching 7 for 11 performance in one of the Ignite games in Vegas. Defensively, Wembanyama is similarly a game-changer, anchoring the French league's stingiest defense (101.4 points per 100 possessions). Though his presence alone deters opposing teams from challenging him in the paint, he still leads the league in blocks. His 8-foot wingspan not only protects the rim, it allows him to recover when he is beat off the perimeter. He is intelligent defending ball screens, exhibits impressive poise and patience staying on his feet and avoids silly fouls, showing great hands swiping down for deflections and steals, which is part of the reason his team leads the league in turnovers generated. The one area scouts want to see him improve is with his physicality on the defensive glass, where he still gets pushed around. Still, it's difficult not to be impressed by how much he has upgraded his intensity level from years past. Next for Wembanyama will be a fascinating change of jerseys as he receives a call-up to represent the French national team for the first time at the senior level in a pair of FIBA World Cup qualifying games. France will play a challenging road game in Lithuania on Nov. 11, one of the top teams in Europe, followed by a home game on Nov. 14 against Bosnia and Herzegovina. These matchups will offer scouts yet another opportunity to see Wembanyama play in a new and different setting, something that should only add to the significant experience he already is garnering prior to being the inevitable No. 1 pick in the 2023 NBA draft. -- Jonathan Givony Oct. 10, 2022 We've been scouting Wembanyama at ESPN since he was 14 years old. But even though former ESPN employee Mike Schmitz called him ""the best prospect in Europe"" in February 2020 and ""the world's most intriguing NBA prospect"" 18 months ago, it's still astonishing to see the progress the projected No. 1 pick from France has continued to make. While Wembanyama, now 18, has always showcased unique versatility, shot-blocking instincts, coordination, feel for the game and perimeter skill, he wasn't always this ultraconfident, aggressive big man who looks to take a team on his shoulders like he did last week. Early in his career, he struggled to play through contact and maintain his intensity for longer stretches, even being deemed soft by some onlookers because of his tendency to float, settle for jumpers and have lapses defensively. While he still has stretches where he gets outmuscled and pushed around on the defensive glass, and he is still very much filling out his lanky frame, Wembanyama's mentality has improved considerably with his consistent engagement and willingness to put his imprint on games.  After making seven 3s and only four rebounds in his first contest in Las Vegas, he showed different facets by unleashing a devastating post arsenal in the second one, dishing four assists and a game-high 11 rebounds -- many of which came from out of his area, and in traffic, while he showed real physicality and grit. -- Jonathan Givony June 24, 2022 Victor Wembanyama is a player we've all been penciling in at No. 1 for the better part of three years, and for good reason. He stands 7-foot-3 with a 7-9 wingspan, has an exceptionally high skill level and feel for the game, and possesses defensive player of the year-type instincts as a shot-blocker. Wembanyama could very well be on the move this offseason thanks to an opt-out clause in his contract that he's expected to execute at the conclusion of the French playoff finals. Reports in France indicate there's a level of unhappiness brewing regarding the way several minor injuries he suffered this season were diagnosed and treated, while the head coach of his current ASVEL team -- owner Tony Parker's brother, T.J. -- hasn't left a lasting impression thus far. G League Ignite and Paris Basket are said to be the main candidates for his signature. The opportunity for Wembanyama to be closer to home in Paris and still play in the competitive EuroCup league will likely be attractive. Most NBA executives feel that Wembanyama simply staying healthy for the duration of next season, while showing progress with his thin frame and ability to handle physicality, should be enough to lock down the top spot. In regard to Wembanyama's candidacy for the top pick, it's worth keeping a close eye on how the three big men who just heard their names called atop the 2022 NBA draft -- Jabari Smith, Chet Holmgren and Paolo Banchero -- fare as rookies. Not every executive agrees that selecting a big man at No. 1 is an ideal use of a team's resources, in terms of the value they return in the modern game. Should Wembanyama struggle to stay healthy, or not improve as much as hoped, there's a group of extremely talented prospects right behind him looking to show there's a conversation about why big playmakers who can be the engine of an NBA offense deserve just as much consideration atop the draft. -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 Wembanyama is the true prize of this class and the best prospect in the world regardless of age. I've long considered the 18-year-old French big man the best prospect I've personally ever evaluated, and at 7-3 with a 7-9 wingspan and 9-7 standing reach, he's starting to turn that sky-high potential into real production for the ASVEL team in France. After missing some time because of injury earlier in the year, Wembanyama has hit stride over the past 10 games (EuroLeague and France Pro A), averaging 13.0 points, 5.9 rebounds and 2.5 blocks in 21.6 minutes while shooting 63% from 2 and 50% from 3. Even more impressive than the production has been how Wembanyama is getting his numbers. ASVEL is springing him free with off-ball screens like a wing, unleashing his feathery shooting touch. With his handle and footwork on display, he has been looking like a bigger Kevin Durant at times by splashing self-created step-back 3s. He's starting to add a more advanced midpost package, fading into back-shoulder turnarounds with incredible ease. He's getting to lobs no other player on the planet could even think of. On top of that, he's protecting the rim at an elite level -- well ahead of Rudy Gobert at the same stage -- while also showing the ability to step out and switch onto guards unlike any player we've previously seen at his height. Wembanyama is the only player in EuroLeague history to record a block percentage over 12%. He still has his lapses on the defensive glass, can get a little overzealous offensively and with a lean frame has some questions to answer about his durability. But Wembanyama is a one-of-one-caliber prospect, a franchise changer and a future NBA MVP so long as he can stay healthy. He's the exact type of superstar that could quickly turn the Thunder into a playoff team and future contender the moment he puts on that Oklahoma City hat. -- ESPN Jan. 21, 2022 Projected No. 1 pick Victor Wembanyama is a household name among draft die-hards by now. A prospect I've been evaluating closely since he was 13, the 7-3 phenom with a never-ending wingspan and rare skill level for his size does everything on both ends, and has already proved himself against this year's projected top pick, Holmgren, last summer on the FIBA circuit, going for 22 points, 8 boards and 8 blocks in a narrow loss to the United States. Likely the only thing that can hold him back from stardom are injuries, which he's battled this season with ASVEL given his height and thin frame. -- ESPN Jul. 14, 2021 Playing up by two years (and still eligible for the 2023 version of this event), Wembanyama was both the most impactful player in Latvia as well as the clear-cut best long-term prospect seen here. He thoroughly outplayed Holmgren in a thrilling head-to-head matchup despite being more than 18 months younger, and looked to be en route to carrying France to a historic gold medal before some very questionable whistles forced him to sit the final three minutes of what would become a loss to Team USA. Still, Wembanyama more than made his point during his time on the floor, posting an impressive stat line of 22 points, 8 rebounds and 8 blocks in 27 minutes and coming up with several highlights on both ends of the floor that immediately went viral and showcased the incredibly unique talent he offers. He had a great case to be named MVP of the tournament. Standing 7-foot-2 barefoot with a near-7-foot-9 wingspan and 9-foot-7-plus standing reach, Wembanyama is as fluid, graceful and coordinated a big man as you'll find, gliding up and down the floor, getting off the ground effortlessly for blocks and dunks, and displaying an uncommon skill set and feel for the game for a player his size and age. He can score from anywhere on the floor, with a picture-perfect shooting stroke that will make him a dangerous 3-point threat in very short order, as well as the ball-handling ability, passing, interior footwork and touch needed to create his own shot inside the arc and score with an array of turnaround jumpers. He's an incredible presence as a lob-catching threat due to his reach, soft hands and the quickness with which he gets off his feet, and also knocked down 78% of his free throws to capitalize on the many attempts he inevitably draws from the charity stripe. While exceptionally talented offensively, Wembanyama is even more impactful defensively at this stage, showing incredible instincts as a rim protector to go along with superb mobility and length. He regularly switches onto guards and shows terrific patience containing on the perimeter, staying down on fakes and then finishing plays with a block or strong contest. His work ethic, attitude and approach to the game match his extraordinary talent and give NBA talent evaluators plenty of room to be excited about his ability to reach his full potential. Wembanyama will spend the next two years with Tony Parker's Euroleague club ASVEL in France before, barring any surprises, becoming the No. 1 pick in the 2023 draft. He'll need to work on his lanky, 215-pound frame carefully to avoid injuries and show that his lack of strength won't be too much of an issue competing in arguably the most physical league in the world. -- Jonathan Givony Apr. 29, 2021 At 7-foot-2 barefoot, with a 7-foot-9 wingspan, a massive standing reach, winglike agility, soft touch from 3, tremendous timing as a shot-blocker and excellent feel as a passer, 17-year-old Victor Wembanyama is the world's most intriguing NBA prospect. I made the 14-hour drive from Belgrade, Serbia, to Strasbourg, France, to get an updated look at Wembanyama, whom we've been evaluating extensively since he was 13 years old and have highlighted everywhere from ESPN.com to SVP over the years. Although Wembanyama, who plays for Nanterre just outside of Paris, was handed a DNP in the first-division game against Strasbourg, we were able to watch an hourlong warm-up, evaluate his physical progression and sit down with the teenage sensation. What exactly is it that Wembanyama believes is so fascinating to NBA scouts and executives? ""The word I'd say is versatile,"" Wembanyama said of his game. ""Being able to score at any level, any moment in the game. Taking responsibilities. Maybe 'Mr. Do Everything.'"" Wembanyama isn't NBA draft-eligible until 2023, but he is widely considered one of the best long-term prospects in the world, as long as he can remain healthy and stay on his current development path. The French player isn't nearly as polished as a prospect such as Paolo Banchero, the projected No. 1 pick in 2022, or even Chet Holmgren, who sits at No. 2 in 2022. You could surely make the argument that big playmakers such as Cade Cunningham are more valuable than bigs in today's NBA. With the stagnant development of Emoni Bates, we've also been reminded of the dangers in tabbing young prospects ""the next big thing"" before they produce against elite competition. But to call Wembanyama the world's most intriguing prospect is not irresponsible or exaggerated. I've never seen a prospect quite like him, one whose learning curve figures to be aided by his perfect English, dedication to his craft and understanding of where he still needs to improve. Although Wembanyama missed 2.5 months with a stress fracture in his lower leg, he is now starting to earn first-division minutes with Nanterre, most recently registering 12 points, six rebounds and two blocks in just 14 minutes in a win over Orleans. Wembanyama completely changed the game in the second half with his defensive presence and floor spacing. Not only can he shoot the 3 with incredible ease for his size, he already anchors a defense like a veteran with his instincts and timing. -- ESPN Feb. 12, 2020 Wembanyama wowed NBA scouts at ANGT, finishing the tourney with averages of 15.8 points, 12.0 rebounds, 6.0 blocks and 2.8 steals in just 28.1 minutes over the course of four games for Nanterre. The flashes he showed in key areas are unlike any player I've ever evaluated at that age. In his first interview with an American media outlet, Wembanyama said that he now stands over 7-foot-2 and weighs around 198 pounds, with a 7-foot-8 wingspan. Of course, the prototypical NBA center is shrinking as the league gets smaller. But Wembanyama is different. Despite his huge feet and thin frame, he moves like a wing. Not only does he put a lid on the rim like Rudy Gobert, he also shows the floor-spacing potential of a young Kristaps Porzingis, with a far better handle and passing feel. Wembanyama will push off the break into pull-up jumpers or throw long outlets or behind the back passes to open teammates. ""That comes from the fact that I've always been balling since I was young,"" Wembanyama said. ""Even when I was not in a club yet, when I was 5 or 6 years old, I always had a ball."" Wembanyama knocked down spot-up and off-screen 3s, step-back jumpers, deep-corner turnarounds from the mid post and pull-ups unlike any other 7-foot-2 player in the world. Once he is surrounded by more talent, his passing vision should stand out even more. On top of that, he has a great approach to the game. He encourages his teammates, dives on the floor for loose balls and calls out defensive coverages. There are a few minor drawbacks. He can improve as a defensive rebounder and become a more consistent 3-point shooter. He settles for jumpers a bit. And you never want to place too grand of expectations on a 16-year-old, especially one who will have to prove his body can hold up at the highest level. But he's checking all the boxes so far. Had Wembanyama grown up in the United States, he would likely be a household name already; but he has been able to develop at his own pace in Europe. Last summer, the goal was the U16 European Championship. Wembanyama led the tournament in player efficiency rating (PER), rebound percentage and blocks per 40 minutes (9.0). This season, the goal was becoming a productive player for the under-21 Espoirs club. Wembanyama is averaging more than 20 points and 6.6 blocks per 40 minutes and posting a 25.8 PER through 13 games. This summer, he'll star for France at the under-17 World Championships in Bulgaria. Then maybe next year he'll start to see more time with Nanterre's first team in France Pro A. France isn't known for its coaching or development system, so it'll be interesting to see how Wembanyama develops, especially physically. ""I'm not focusing on [studying] one player; I'm trying to take things from every good player,"" Wembanyama said. ""I don't want to become a player who looks like another. I want everyone to refer to me like, 'I want to become like him.'"" -- ESPN Aug. 25, 2019 There's no other prospect in the world quite like 15-year-old, 7-foot-2 French wonder Victor Wembanyama. The 2023 NBA draft is shaping up to be a generational crop given the likely age limit change in 2022 along with the incredible talent in the 2021 and 2022 high school classes, led by phenom Emoni Bates. Although still at an extremely early stage of development, Wembanyama is emerging as a potential co-star to Bates, health permitting. Long and gangly with outstanding coordination, Wembanyama wowed NBA scouts with his tools, talent and production at the recent U16 European Championships in Udine, helping lead France to a silver medal while finishing the tournament first in PER. Even with a paper-thin frame, Wembaynama posted record-breaking rim protection numbers, becoming the first player in FIBA history to block at least 9.0 shots per 40 minutes, swatting 37 total attempts in just 165 minutes. While blessed with never-ending arms surpassing the length of Rudy Gobert's, Wembanyama also has outstanding timing and a revved-up motor, giving him all the makings of an elite defensive anchor. He even showed the ability to step out and guard the perimeter some, sitting in a stance and clapping his hands, outwardly embracing the challenge. On top of the eye-opening rim protection and defensive versatility, Wembanyama hauled in 16.2 boards per 40 minutes thanks to his massive rebounding radius, often flying in on the offensive glass for tip-ins from different vantage points. He'll surely hang his hat on shot-blocking, rebounding and lob-catching at the highest level, but unlike prior bigs in his mold, it's his feel for the game and advanced skill level that makes him such a rarity. We've marvelled at physical prospects before, including Kristaps Porzingis, Joel Embiid, Mo Bamba, Rudy Gobert, Zhou Qi, Boban Marjanovic and 16-year-old Senegalese center Ibou Badji in recent years. But save for maybe Marjanovic, none of them were quite as advanced as Wembanyama at the same age in regard to skill and feel for the game. Of course, it's far too early to pencil Wembanyama in as an NBA star, especially with the declining value of centers in today's game. Putting too grand of an expectation on a 15-year-old has proved faulty time and time again. But most of Wembanyama's shortcomings should dissolve with physical maturity, and the Nanterre product fits the modern game. He already has the skill foundation that's rare for bigs his age, especially those who can block shots and catch lobs. He'll fire full-court outlets on the money, behind-the-back passes on the move or no-look dimes to shooters in the half court with either hand. Although he operated more as a roller and lob threat in Udine, watch Wembanyama warm up or play with Nanterre at the U18 level and you'll see him handle the ball fluidly and stretch the floor with soft touch, playing mostly on the perimeter. He gets excellent rotation from the free throw line even if the results are inconsistent, and he has the type of mechanics that should eventually allow him to space the floor out to 3 regularly. Add in the passing feel, soft hands, ambidextrous touch and stretch potential to his frame, and it makes sense why NBA scouts struggled to find any comparison for him during what was, for most, their first extended viewing of the high-level prospect. Anything can happen over the next few years, but if it all hits, Wembanyama could certainly acquire unicorn status at the highest level. Whether or not Wembanyama is able to reach his sky-high potential will largely revolve around how he develops physically, as he has already grown almost four inches in less than 18 months. With huge feet, big hands and a young frame, he could very well add another inch or two, and there simply isn't a track record of ultra-durable giants in the NBA (see Porzingis and Bol Bol). With that said, few over 7-foot players on the planet move like Wembanyama, and he has an outstanding support system full of current and former athletes. Watching him prepare for Nanterre U18 games or a U15 tournament in the past, he goes through long stretching routines and seems to have a great grasp on the importance of injury prevention. It will be interesting to see at what level Wembanyama plays next season, as there's been some talk in scouting circles that he could spend time practicing with the first team in Nanterre -- his home club, where he recently agreed to a multiyear deal -- in the preseason. Regardless of whether he competes in the under-18 or under-21 level, Wembanyama, who is eligible to play in the U16s again next summer, made an everlasting first impression on NBA scouts in Udine. -- ESPN Apr. 8, 2018 The 2004-born French big man is gaining steam as one of the top long-term prospects in all of Europe. Most American prospects don't surface in scouting circles until age 15 or 16, but with the number of clubs and agents in Europe, the top players are generally identified much earlier with many turning pro as teenagers. Competing with his home club of Nanterre in the under-15 Lions Cup, Wembanyama showed his incredible physical upside and talent level for his age. Wembanyama has massive hands, size 19.5 shoes, toothpick thighs and an incredible reach. For reference, Rudy Gobert was 6 inches shorter and playing on the wing when he was Wembanyama's age. While there have been plenty of young prospects with freakish measurements, it's Wembanyama skill level combined with his unique physical profile that makes him so intriguing. He shoots an easy 3-ball with soft touch, steps into midrange jumpers or floaters off the dribble, has a fairly advanced handle for his size and can pass with either hand, playing unselfishly. Despite his lack of lower-body strength, he's coordinated and competitive, protecting the rim impressively with sharp timing when fully engaged. Wembanyama's long-term success will depend on staying healthy and maintaining a strong physical regimen, as he's nowhere near his peak athletically. His development can shoot in a variety of directions, as he's skilled enough to trend toward a stretch big, long enough to become a lob-catcher/shot-blocker and talented enough with the ball to become a point-center type. Highly touted, young prospects fail to live up to lofty expectations every year, but Wembanyama's background and support system makes us more comfortable even discussing him as a prospect at this age. His mother was described as the ""Kendrick Perkins of women's basketball in France"" for her tough mentality as a 6-3 big. Wembanyama's father was an accomplished long jumper, and his sister a champion basketball player on France's under-16 national team. His family is said to have a great grasp of the importance of developing him slowly. Wembanyama played with Barcelona on loan at the 2018 Minicopa in Spain but long-term will stay with Nanterre. Next season he'll play in the France under-18 league while practicing with the under-21 team. -- ESPN","The basketball gods smiled on San Antonio on lottery night, delivering the first overall pick to select a franchise-changing talent in Wembanyama. After toiling in mediocrity and not advancing past the first round of the playoffs since 2017, the Spurs finally went all-in on rebuilding and were awarded the most hyped prospect since LeBron James. They'll add him to a strong group of young wing and forward prospects in Jeremy Sochan, Devin Vassell, Keldon Johnson and Malaki Branham. San Antonio will hope to be competitive enough to vye for the playoffs sometime in the not-too-distant future, led by a rejuvenated Gregg Popovich hoping to leave on a positive note before retirement.Player fitWembanyama would be a plug-and-play option on any roster, but his fit with the Spurs looks particularly snug. His extraordinary skill level should allow him to immediately become the primary target offensively on a team sorely lacking in shot-creation, while stepping to anchor a defense that ranked worst in the league last season. In Sochan, he has an ideal frontcourt partner who brings physicality, unselfishness, feel for the game, passing and defensive versatility. He's played quite a bit of center in his career, allowing him to bring Wembanyama's slight frame along slowly handling some of the more punishing matchups they might encounter. After playing 62 games without missing a single contest, the Spurs will likely want to be strategic about the load they put on him next year, especially if he represents France in the FIBA World Cup in August as expected. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Brandon Miller",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alabama","ALA",NA,NA,NA,"March 27, 2023 MVP honors in the SEC tournament put Miller firmly in the mix for the No. 2 pick, as he led Alabama's high-powered offense and showed significant potential as a big playmaking wing with outstanding passing and shot-making.  A groin injury slowed Miller in the NCAA tournament and might have contributed to Alabama having one of its worst offensive games of the season in its Sweet 16 loss to San Diego State. Miller shot 3-for-19 from the field with six turnovers, while the Crimson Tide were limited to 3-for-27 from beyond the arc. Miller's shooting splits against elite competition are alarming. He converted 39% of his 2-pointers and 32% of his 3s in 19 games against top-50 opponents but shot 63% on 2s and 45% on 3s in his 18 other games, per Bart Torvik. Miller's inability to create separation against San Diego State's defense raised many of the red flags previously identified, with his lack of explosiveness and reliance on difficult attempts around the basket and beyond the arc. Still, it was encouraging to see Miller's aggressiveness, extraordinary pass timing and creativity off a live dribble with his off-hand, having the type of vision and playmaking ability every NBA team would love to have in a 6-9 guard. Even when he wasn't scoring, Miller continued to bring impressive intensity on the defensive end, something that had been in question before this season. Miller, a 40% 3-point shooter before the NCAA tournament, hit a slump at a bad time for Alabama, hitting just 3-for-19 in three games from beyond the arc. That shouldn't play a large role in how he's viewed as an NBA prospect, though, considering his shot-making prowess and 86% free throw percentage. Instead, teams will wonder just how heavy a role Miller can shoulder as a half-court creator in the NBA, something his development as a passer, lack of explosiveness and still-developing frame will help determine. Ultimately, the team that gets the No. 2 pick in the draft and what that team has on its roster -- plus what it is able to uncover regarding Miller's involvement in the shooting of Jamea Harris, for which he has not been charged -- will be deciding factors in whether it's Miller or G League Ignite guard Scoot Henderson who gets the call first on draft night. Miller's season as a whole was a resounding success, even if he's disappointed in how it ended. -- Jonathan Givony March 20, 2023Miller didn't have a great weekend by his standards, shooting 5-for-22 from the field in two games and not getting his first basket until 53 minutes into the NCAA tournament, but Alabama took care of business with two blowouts over Maryland and Texas A&M Corpus-Christi. He was held out of practice on Friday with a groin injury and likely wasn't operating at 100% all weekend, but said he never had any doubt about his availability for either game. Even when not at his best, Miller showed what makes him potentially the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft with the outstanding mix he brings of size, shot-making, passing, defensive versatility, feel for the game and competitiveness, as he was able to contribute in all facets even when the ball wasn't going through the basket for him. He makes all the right reads and the game is easy for his teammates with the way he passes ahead, moves the ball out of double-teams and drives with his head up looking to dish off. The intensity he's playing with defensively by denying off the ball, recovering to the rim to protect the basket, and the hustle he shows getting back in transition and crashing the glass bodes well for his outlook. -- Jonathan Givony March 14, 2023 Miller will be the most closely scrutinized prospect in the tournament after rising dramatically up draft boards thanks to winning SEC player of the year and an All-American season. Standing 6-foot-9 with the ability to handle, pass and shoot, Miller fits a clear mold every NBA team is actively seeking in the modern game, being able to slide seamlessly between being a big guard or a small-ball power forward. He brings a high skill level, dynamic shot-making prowess, a strong feel for the game and enough competitiveness defensively. NBA teams are still looking to get a better feel for Miller's ability to be called on to generate efficient offense late in games and with the shot clock running down. There's a big gap between the best and worst teams in the SEC this season, and Miller was somewhat of a mixed bag against better competition, seeing his shooting percentages drop dramatically in the 16 games Alabama has faced off with top-50 caliber competition, shooting just 42% inside the arc and 34% for 3, with a poor assist-to-turnover ratio, per Bart Torvik. How Miller fares in high-leverage moments as the stakes rise in the NCAA tournament will go a long way in determining his ability to solidify himself as the No. 3 prospect in the draft and potentially even challenge Scoot Henderson at No. 2 with the somewhat underwhelming season Henderson is having for the G League Ignite.-- Jonathan Givony Dec. 1, 2022Miller, the No. 1 scorer in college basketball among freshmen, showed what makes him unique at the PK85 tournament as a 6-foot-9 guard with dynamic shot-making ability, a strong feel for the game and defensive versatility. Miller went 9-for-21 from beyond the arc in Portland for Alabama while rebounding prolifically, authoring several impressive blocks and getting to the free throw line more than five times per game. NBA scouts scour the globe for oversized wings with length who can handle and pass with either hand, play with energy on defense and make shots in a variety of ways, giving him a very high floor as a prospect. On the downside, Miller lacks explosiveness creating off the dribble and struggled to generate high-percentage offense for himself inside the arc, going a dismal 8-for-34 (24%) from 2-point range and having his shot blocked far more than you'd expect at his size. Just how much of a half-court creator he projects to be in the NBA is something scouts are pondering, which will help determine if he can eventually threaten to crack the top five of this draft or ends up being more of a mid- or late-lottery-caliber prospect. Being a sophomore age-wise, having just turned 20, is something to consider as well. The fact that Miller has significantly ramped up his intensity defensively and is playing an unselfish brand of basketball is promising, and if he can continue to make strides as a playmaker operating out of pick-and-roll and isolation situations, he'll be well positioned come June. -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 At 6-9 with a nice frame, fluidity and dynamic shot-making prowess, Miller looks like an easy one-and-done candidate on first glance, as the NBA is actively scouring the globe for players in this mold. Miller shows real offensive versatility with his ability to handle and pass in addition to his tough shot-making ability, giving him a great framework to build off in addition to his solid scoring instincts and budding defensive versatility he shows in smaller doses. Miller was at times more of a theoretical prospect in high school than an overly productive, efficient player, as his shot selection, decision-making and intensity often left a lot to be desired at the very low level of competition he played against in Tennessee. Getting stronger, tougher and showing he can play a winning style in college could certainly make him a lottery-level prospect, but some of the doubts that have arisen around his profile could also cause him to slide if he struggles to make the transition to the college level. -- Jonathan Givony ","The Hornets sit at a crossroads. After drawing lottery luck at No. 2 as a new ownership group takes over, there is a window for them to build around 21-year-old star guard LaMelo Ball and whomever they select. Brandon Miller and Scoot Henderson would be franchise building blocks. The roster itself will require further work for the Hornets to re-enter the playoff picture, as their last few drafts have been poor. But this pick presents a major opportunity to inject some energy and star power into the organization. Player fitMiller's upside as a tall perimeter creator with two-way impact ultimately moved him to No. 2 on the board for many teams over the course of his impressive college season. After taking their time to do diligence on Miller and Henderson, bringing both players in for two rounds of workouts and interviews, the Hornets landed here, choosing to pair Miller with franchise point guard Ball, rather than try to make Ball and Henderson co-exist. Miller's ability to score over the top of defenses, as well as the spacing he generates with the threat of his shot, should make him immediately impactful for Charlotte as the Hornets transition to new owners this summer. He could be the exact type of scorer they need to take the next step toward relevance. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Scoot Henderson",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"USA","USA",NA,NA,NA,"Nov. 7, 2022 Scoot Henderson, the projected No. 2 pick in the draft, had a productive stat line in his regular-season debut with 25 points and seven assists. But he wasn't able to help the Ignite avoid blowing a 29-point first-half lead and losing their home opener. His shot selection left something to be desired, as he was baited into difficult midrange jumpers all game long by Oklahoma City's deep drop defense, hitting just four of his 12 pull-up 2s and not attempting a single 3-pointer. He was able to draw 10 fouls, though, some of which appeared fortuitous, but he wasn't able to control the tempo of the game as effectively as he did in the Ignite's opening game against Wembanyama's Metropolitans 92, during which he looked far more aggressive getting out in the open floor and attacking the basket in the half court. Defensively, Henderson showed some flashes, fighting over screens and generating turnovers both on and off the ball with his quick feet, strong frame and long arms. But he often was sleepy off the ball, not always maintaining his intensity, especially when things weren't going his way offensively. Henderson's second game of the season on Sunday was similarly a mixed bag, as he needed 28 shots to score 25 points and made some critical mistakes down the stretch that played a role in his team coughing up a late lead and losing a 120-119 heartbreaker to Salt Lake City. Henderson's best moments looked all-star caliber. When he is at his best, he is using his terrific ballhandling ability and explosive change of gears to get into the paint and either finish with creativity or dish off to teammates after moving the defense. He threw in several good-looking pull-up jumpers, had a few incredible highlights in the open court and played a strong game defensively, using his frame, quick feet and hands to generate plenty of turnovers and looking much improved in that area from last season. Henderson's decision-making in the half court is still very much a work in progress -- not a shock considering he is an 18-year-old leading a group of mostly draft-eligible players against veteran professionals. With Salt Lake City shrinking the floor late and daring him to shoot jumpers, Henderson had some wild moments forcing the issue and coming up empty when his team needed a bucket, surprisingly causing the Ignite to put the ball in the hands of teammate Sidy Cissoko during their crucial final possession. Overall, Henderson showed his substantial talent against players significantly older than him without even playing all that well by his standards. It was yet another indication of how much long-term upside he possesses. The gap between him and Wembanyama looks considerable at the moment, and scouts will want to see Henderson help a very young Ignite team win some games in the G League if he is to hold off the likes of Amen Thompson, Nick Smith and others from the No. 2 spot in the draft. -- Jonathan Givony Oct. 10, 2022 A bone bruise suffered by Scoot Henderson just 4.5 minutes into the second game ended up knocking the projected No. 2 pick out of the remainder of the contest for precautionary reasons. But considering what Henderson showed two days earlier, with 28 points and nine assists, and combined with Wembanyama's fireworks, few came away disappointed from the overall experience. Henderson has clearly taken a major step forward from last season with his body, explosiveness, intensity level, perimeter shooting, half-court playmaking and defense. He looks like he is going to be difficult to dislodge from the No. 2 spot. Every team in the NBA is looking for a guard in Henderson's mold who is electric when changing gears off the dribble, can rise up sharply pulling up in midrange spots or beyond the arc, finishes creatively around the basket and finds open teammates on the move with timing and vision. Wembanyama himself put it best at a news conference, saying, ""If I was never born, I think he would deserve the first spot,"" while also calling Henderson a great player and his favorite in this draft class. -- Jonathan Givony June 24, 2022 Should Wembanyama struggle to stay healthy, or not improve as much as hoped, there's a group of extremely talented prospects right behind him looking to show there's a conversation about why big playmakers who can be the engine of an NBA offense deserve just as much consideration atop the draft. That starts with Scoot Henderson, who has Jaden Ivey-esque explosiveness changing gears in the open court, taking a piece of the paint and finishing powerfully above the rim. Henderson's court vision is more advanced than Ivey's at the same stage, but he's 2 inches shorter and his struggles as a perimeter shooter (22% from 3) are something teams will want to study closely next year. To be fair, Henderson is far from a non-shooter in terms of his mechanics and ability to throw in pullup jumpers when defenses go under ball screens (he made 43% of his off-the-dribble jumpers last season, per Synergy Sports Technology), and the fact that he hit nearly 80% of his free throws last season leaves significant room for optimism, especially considering he's still only 18. -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2021 Henderson had an excellent debut season with Ignite, posting 14.3 points, 4.8 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 1.6 steals in 28 minutes per game despite being just 17 years old. He was especially impressive down the stretch, shooting the ball much better as the season moved on and making real strides as a playmaker as well. Henderson's physical tools give him NBA All-Star-caliber upside. He has a terrific frame, a near 6-9 wingspan and powerful explosiveness operating in the open court, playing off hesitation moves and finishing downhill drives above the rim, often in highlight-reel fashion. He's also a flashy passer who shows the ability to create off a live dribble and get teammates involved unselfishly. Henderson's decision-making, shooting and defense all need work, but that's to be expected at his age and he has huge potential to grow into, making him a real candidate as the potential No. 1 pick if Wembanyama doesn't take the next step in his development. -- Jonathan Givony Oct. 29, 2021 Henderson, 17, was injured during my time in Walnut Creek, but he isn't draft-eligible until 2023, giving scouts plenty of time to evaluate the Georgia native. Based on what we saw at Impact Basketball in Las Vegas during the 2021 pre-draft process, Henderson has all the ingredients of a future top-5 pick thanks to his stellar physical profile, improved shooting and explosive style of play. Henderson measured 6-2, 189 pounds with a 6-8 wingspan, comparing favorably to Derrick Rose and Eric Bledsoe when they were 19. He's the first Ignite prospect to agree to a multiyear contract, a welcome sign for the program as a whole. There's an argument to be made that Henderson is the best long-term prospect to take the floor for the Ignite this season, gaining invaluable experience against G Leaguers for two full seasons before entering the NBA. Given the length of time with the program, Henderson's NBA-readiness come 2023 will be the most accurate barometer for the effectiveness of the development system as a whole, and could entice other under-18 prospects to consider the Ignite as a legitimate pathway to the NBA. -- ESPN","The Trailblazers seem intent on threading the needle between maximizing Damian Lillard's prime and stockpiling for the future, making moves to stay competitive without taking shortcuts that might hurt their outlook for when the Lillard era inevitably comes to an end. The performance of 2022 lottery pick, Shaedon Sharpe, has to be encouraging when paired with the good fortune of moving up on lottery night to snag the No. 3 pick, setting the team up nicely for the long term. The main question will be how to keep the soon-to-be 33-year-old Lillard happy if the team heads for a third-straight lottery appearance. The roster is lacking both in rim protection and defensive versatility in the backcourt, neither of which the No. 3 pick will fix in the short-term.Player fitPortland's pick was more or less made by Charlotte, as this has widely been viewed as a three-player draft for a good part of the season, with the team picking third. With the talent drop-off after three, there was never really any conversation about any other prospects beyond Miller and Henderson. Miller being selected second made Henderson the easy pick here, and there are reasons to believe he can coexist in a backcourt with Lillard and Anfernee Simons, provided his defense and perimeter shooting improve. Henderson's explosiveness in the open court and ability to change gears in the half-court gives the Trailblazers another big offensive playmaker. It will be up to him to utilize his tremendous frame and 6-9 wingspan to his advantage defensively to carve out playing time. Several NBA teams selecting behind Portland speculated in recent days that the Trail Blazers may in fact look to pick Amen Thompson over Henderson. Ultimately, this has always been considered this a three-player draft and there was never any thought about selecting anyone besides Henderson or Miller.-- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Amen Thompson",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Overtime Elite","Overtime Elite",NA,NA,NA," Oct. 28, 2022 The biggest draw for scouts was the presence of the projected top-10 picks with elite physical talent, lockdown defensive prowess and an intriguing combination of open-court scoring, dynamic playmaking, feel for the game and creativity. Amen Thompson had a strong showing in drills and live action, showing the progress he's made as an outside shooter along with his highlight-reel finishing, live-ball passing and competitiveness defensively that gives him a high floor as a prospect as well as significant long-term upside. Thompson has steadily risen up draft boards this summer and fall thanks to outstanding showings against high-level competition at the TBT tournament, an overseas tour against ACB squads Manresa and Girona, Adriatic league teams Mega Basket and Studentski Centar, and an exhibition game in Phoenix against Australian NBL squad Adelaide 36ers -- who then went onto defeat the Phoenix Suns. While G League Ignite's Scoot Henderson could very well solidify himself as the main consolation prize in the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes, Thompson's super size (6-foot-7), explosiveness and incredible highlights he produces getting low to the ground off powerful hesitation moves and finishing with extraordinary body control and agility in the lane give him a chance to surpass Henderson ultimately if he continues along his current trajectory. Having passed early tests, the question now will be how the Thompsons continue their development, as OTE returns to mostly playing high school-level competition in their six-team league schedule from November to mid-March. After being on separate teams last season, Amen will reunite with his twin brother Ausar on the City Reapers, offering scouts a chance to evaluate the two alongside each other. The move offers pros and cons for both players and scouts. On one hand, it will force the twins to show they can impact the game without having the ball in their hands all the time, a situation that will more closely replicate their experience early in their NBA careers, where they will share the floor with other talented players. On the other, it's not easy for NBA scouts to differentiate between the identical twins in live action, and the fact that Amen is the more dominant ballhandler of the two may lead to his brother Ausar being overshadowed at times. While they're different players in many regards -- Ausar is usually considered more of a wing than Amen, who is clearly a guard -- they also share quite a few similarities in terms of their physical attributes, shooting, powerful downhill driving and ability to guard multiple positions. Although NBA scouts don't unanimously agree on who the better prospect of the twins is, there is no question Amen has been much more productive so far than Ausar, who hasn't made the same jump in terms of scoring efficiency or aggressiveness from last season. Amen is currently ranked No. 3 on ESPN's mock draft, while Ausar is No. 8, a situation that was flipped for much of last year. Kevin Ollie, Head of Coaching and Basketball Development at OTE, discussed what makes the twins unique. ""God has sprinkled magical dust on these two,"" he said. ""Being 6-7 and being able to jump like that? It's hard to peg them in a position. Defensively they are both incredible."" He also spoke about what the Thompson twins need to improve on. ""We want to get them better off the ball. On the ball they are amazing,"" he said. ""They can still grow from a leadership standpoint, being vocal. From a leadership standpoint that's important. Off the court, they are quiet but they are starting to find their voice. Ausar talks more than Amen. We need to make the game easier for teammates. ""They want to be perfect a lot. I would rather have a guy want to be perfect than need to challenge them. We don't need to turn them up. They compete at everything they do. They don't want to lose. We're working on their shots. Working on different moves. Mastering the fundamentals. It's all about footwork and balance. Their shots are getting better. They put the time in. Each and every day they do it the right way."" -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 The older of the twins by one minute, Amen isn't as quite as productive as his brother, but is more of a ballhandling, shot-creating guard who is virtually unstoppable in the open floor, showing an incredible combination of power, quickness and explosiveness getting off his feet. His footwork and body control as a slasher lead to some outrageous moments when paired with his quick-twitch ability to change gears out of hesitation moves or in-and-out dribbles, and he's a willing ball mover on top of that who can really pass off a live dribble. Thompson is an outstanding defender as well, showing an incredible knack for rebounding, blocking shots and getting in passing lanes, often being tasked with guarding point guards, but having the size and strength to hold his ground against big men as well. Shooting is the big thing teams will want to monitor next season -- he shot just 23% for 3 and 53% from the free throw line. OTE says it will significantly upgrade the level of competition its teams face next season, something NBA teams pointed out they'd like to see improve, which could include some matchups with international opponents. -- Jonathan Givony Jan. 21, 2022 Two sleepers to keep in mind are the Thompson twins -- Ausar and Amen -- playing with Overtime Elite, both of whom are in our top 10 after showing a great deal of intrigue 13 games into their seasons. Both have everything the NBA is looking for as high-end lottery prospects from a physical standpoint, with incredible frames, length, fluidity and explosiveness. In terms of defensive versatility, intensity, court vision, transition scoring and ability to play anywhere on the floor, there is no one else like them in the class. The questions come on the offensive end, specifically in the half court. Ausar is faster and stronger, and he's the better shooter and overall scorer, but he leaves something to be desired, hitting just 27% of his 3-pointers (9-for-34) and 50% of his free throws. Amen is the superior passer and ball handler and is said to be more the alpha personality of the two, but he struggles to put the ball in the basket at times against better defenses. How much progress the two are able to make with their mechanics, touch and consistency from beyond the arc will play a major role in where they'll end up being picked, and perhaps how OTE as a venture is viewed. Turning 19 next week, agewise the twins would have been eligible for the 2022 NBA draft if they were international prospects. -- Jonathan Givony ","Having made top-three selections in the past couple drafts, the Rockets wound up falling in the lottery and face a key decision at No. 4, with the goal of competing for the playoffs. Houston owes its 2024 and 2026 first-round picks to Oklahoma City with top-four protections and also owes the Thunder top-10 protected 2025 swap rights, adding further impetus for the Rockets to try and take a step forward, rather than potentially convey high-value picks. That said, there's no true win-now pick to be made here, and the flip side of that argument is that this may be the final opportunity for the Rockets to take a giant swing on a prospect before their draft capital becomes more compromised. Player fit Drafting with the relative luxury of knowing exactly which players would be on the board at No. 4, the Rockets opted to play the upside card on Amen, a player that will help fortify their backcourt and be the type of distributor other young players need to thrive. Amen will be one of the league's best athletes from Day One, but will also need time to adjust to the speed of the game amid a huge leap in competition from Overtime Elite to the NBA. His speed, size and playmaking vision could make him a talented transition player, while his halfcourt effectiveness hangs to some extent on him becoming a workable jump shooter, something that will also take some time. This is one of the bigger risk-reward picks in the draft, but the Rockets, who are hoping to move back closer to the playoff picture next season, are certainly justified in taking a chance. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Ausar Thompson",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Overtime Elite","Overtime Elite",NA,NA,NA,"Dec. 1, 2022 While most NBA eyes have been planted firmly on the opening weeks of college basketball, scouts are still closely monitoring the progress of non-NCAA prospects. One notable development has been the highly efficient month of November that Ausar Thompson had at Overtime Elite, averaging 18.5 points in 26.5 minutes while shooting 59% for 2, 40% for 3 and 73% from the free throw line, while continuing to display the same defensive versatility (3.5 steals, one block) that has always characterized his game. Thompson's shooting mechanics look noticeably improved, especially his footwork and balance, even pulling up off the dribble, and continuing to get good results from the perimeter will go a long way in solidifying himself in the mid-lottery, which is currently wide open. -- Jonathan Givony Oct. 28, 2022 The biggest draw for scouts was the presence of the projected top-10 picks with elite physical talent, lockdown defensive prowess and an intriguing combination of open-court scoring, dynamic playmaking, feel for the game and creativity. Amen Thompson had a strong showing in drills and live action, showing the progress he's made as an outside shooter along with his highlight-reel finishing, live-ball passing and competitiveness defensively that gives him a high floor as a prospect as well as significant long-term upside.

While they're different players in many regards -- Ausar is usually considered more of a wing than Amen, who is clearly a guard -- they also share quite a few similarities in terms of their physical attributes, shooting, powerful downhill driving and ability to guard multiple positions. Although NBA scouts don't unanimously agree on who the better prospect of the twins is, there is no question Amen has been much more productive so far than Ausar, who hasn't made the same jump in terms of scoring efficiency or aggressiveness from last season. Amen is currently ranked No. 3 on ESPN's mock draft, while Ausar is No. 8, a situation that was flipped for much of last year. Kevin Ollie, Head of Coaching and Basketball Development at OTE, discussed what makes the twins unique. ""God has sprinkled magical dust on these two,"" he said. ""Being 6-7 and being able to jump like that? It's hard to peg them in a position. Defensively they are both incredible."" He also spoke about what the Thompson twins need to improve on. ""We want to get them better off the ball. On the ball they are amazing,"" he said. ""They can still grow from a leadership standpoint, being vocal. From a leadership standpoint that's important. Off the court, they are quiet but they are starting to find their voice. Ausar talks more than Amen. We need to make the game easier for teammates. ""They want to be perfect a lot. I would rather have a guy want to be perfect than need to challenge them. We don't need to turn them up. They compete at everything they do. They don't want to lose. We're working on their shots. Working on different moves. Mastering the fundamentals. It's all about footwork and balance. Their shots are getting better. They put the time in. Each and every day they do it the right way."" -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 Thompson has as high an upside as any prospect not named Wembanyama thanks to his NBA tools on the wing at 6-7 with a 6-10 wingspan, quickness with the ball, incredible fluidity, elite leaping ability and strong overall basketball instincts on both ends of the floor. Thompson finished the Overtime Elite season averaging 15.4 points, 8.6 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 2.4 blocks, 1.8 steals and 27.4 minutes across 27 games. While the level of competition needs to improve, Thompson's film is eye-opening regardless of the opponent. He's capable of functioning as a lead shot-creator for stretches, attacking the rim into powerful or finesse finishes with a slow-to-fast pace you see from some of the NBA's best creators. He'll have to continue to address his shooting (25.8% from 3 and 64.8% from the free throw line), but Thompson has touch and is capable of rising into midrange pull-ups and even pull-up 3s. He's a comfortable live dribble passer, showing the type of ambidexterity necessary to pick defenses apart in the NBA. On top of that, Thompson has incredible defensive instincts and quickness reminiscent of a young wing like Herb Jones. Like most teenagers, his consistency and motor can still improve on that end, but he gravitates toward the ball and gets to blocks around the rim few NBA wings could. So long as Thompson can continue to improve his shooting while being challenged more by the level of competition next season, there's no reason he can't solidify his standing as a top-five -- and maybe even top-three -- pick in a league that covets defensive versatility and wing creators. -- ESPN Jan. 21, 2022 Two sleepers to keep in mind are the Thompson twins -- Ausar and Amen -- playing with Overtime Elite, both of whom are in our top 10 after showing a great deal of intrigue 13 games into their seasons. Both have everything the NBA is looking for as high-end lottery prospects from a physical standpoint, with incredible frames, length, fluidity and explosiveness. In terms of defensive versatility, intensity, court vision, transition scoring and ability to play anywhere on the floor, there is no one else like them in the class. The questions come on the offensive end, specifically in the half court. Ausar is faster and stronger, and he's the better shooter and overall scorer, but he leaves something to be desired, hitting just 27% of his 3-pointers (9-for-34) and 50% of his free throws. Amen is the superior passer and ball handler and is said to be more the alpha personality of the two, but he struggles to put the ball in the basket at times against better defenses. How much progress the two are able to make with their mechanics, touch and consistency from beyond the arc will play a major role in where they'll end up being picked, and perhaps how OTE as a venture is viewed. Turning 19 next week, agewise the twins would have been eligible for the 2022 NBA draft if they were international prospects. -- Jonathan Givony ","The Pistons were surely disappointed to fall four spots on lottery night to No. 5, but responded by making Monty Williams the highest-paid coach in the NBA, signaling an intent to turn the page on their rebuilding process. With one of the youngest rosters in the NBA, which hasn't played many games together due to injury, ending the franchise's 15-year playoff series win drought will likely take time, something ownership will need to be patient about. The nucleus of Cade Cunningham, Jaden Ivey and Jalen Duren is surely one of the league's most promising, but the odd glut of big men assembled will need to be sorted out. The Pistons have significant cap space to add veteran talent, and should be in position to compete for a play-in game appearance if they can stay healthy and find a way to get their young players to take the next step in their development. Player fit Thompson brings strong two-way upside on the perimeter, with an aggressive approach and strong work ethic that ultimately helped teams feel secure in selecting him. While his ability to catch and shoot has to continue improving, Thompson at 6-foot-7, is comfortable playing with and without the ball, and has the agility to defend both bigger wings and smaller guards. It will take him some time to adjust to a much more difficult and fast-paced NBA level, and he may not wind up starting from day one in certain situations, but in time, provided he makes enough shots, he should grow into a useful, versatile perimeter option. Troy Weaver vowed to take a ""big swing"" on draft night and did just that, opting for the considerable upside of Ausar Thompson over the alternatives. The Thompson twins, born within a minute of each other, ended up being picked five minutes apart, in the same order they came out of their mother's womb. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Anthony Black",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arkansas","ARK",NA,NA,NA,"March 27, 2023 No one can fault Black for Arkansas' Sweet 16 exit as he had one of his best games of the season, showing vivid glimpses of what makes him one of the most versatile two-way prospects in this draft class.  On defense, he displayed intense ball pressure in the backcourt, fought over screens, recovered to protect the rim out of pick-and-roll, and generated plenty of deflections and steals with his instincts, toughness and energy.  Black was similarly aggressive on offense, something that hasn't always been the case this season, taking the ball strong to the rim and finishing with 11 free throw attempts. UConn's defense prevented him from showing off his passing, one of his best attributes, as his unselfishness passing in transition, finding the rolling big man rolling and skipping the ball to the opposite corner gives him significant potential as a big playmaker.  Black shot only 30% from 3 on the season, his biggest weakness, but it was encouraging to see him not shy away from open looks both pulling up off the dribble and in catch-and-shoot situations. Black does have some things teams can nitpick, but there's no denying he's an outstanding all-around player with an excellent feel for the game who brings significant competitiveness and winning intangibles that should allow him to have a fruitful NBA career.-- Jonathan Givony March 14, 2023  A prospect with sharply contrasting strengths and weaknesses, Black is somewhat of a polarizing prospect among NBA teams. On one hand, he has a case to be considered the best defender in the class, showing outstanding instincts, intensity and technique both on and off the ball, especially with the way he navigates screens. He also is an excellent passer who has shown some real flashes as a big, ballhandling guard with impressive creativity in pick-and-rolls. On the other hand, Black's assertiveness offensively waxes and wanes, especially from the perimeter, where he often looks reluctant to take open shots. He turns the ball over at a high rate and has been generally inconsistent, making it difficult to pinpoint what position and role he projects to play early in his career, especially offensively. A strong finish to the season could propel Black into a different prospect tier, as NBA teams have been waiting for him to give them more reasons to fall in love with his versatility, feel for the game and the many different ways he contributes to winning.-- Jonathan Givony Dec. 1, 2022 Black started the season slowly, posting just 18 points on 18 shots in three games, but hit his stride in a major way in Maui, averaging 22 points, five rebounds and four assists while helping Arkansas to a 2-1 record. Beyond the numbers, it was Black's ability to act as his team's full-time engine that impressed the most, showing a spectacular combination of pace, aggressiveness, physicality, creativity and intelligence operating out of pick-and-roll that you rarely see from a 6-7 guard. Black got inside the paint almost whenever he wanted and made great decisions with the ball, using and rejecting screens, changing speeds with outstanding ball-handling ability, either to finish through contact himself or find teammates on the move. On top of that, he brought his typical energy and versatility making plays all over the floor defensively and crashing the glass instinctually on both ends with his underrated explosiveness. Scouts have always loved the way Black impacts winning with all the little things he does on both ends of the floor, but the fact that he was able to shoulder such a heavy on-ball role and be effective at this level of competition as a freshman puts him in a different tier of prospect relative to where he started the year. Black's ability to keep defenses honest when the ball isn't in his hands is something to monitor (he's shooting a respectable 33% for 3), as is how well his newfound scoring aggressiveness translates to SEC play, but he's knocking on the door of the top-10 right now and is in a great position to continue to rise. -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 The 18-year-old Black is one of the more versatile guards in the country, with the ability to play on the ball at 6-7 as a lead playmaker while also adding value as a fill-in-the-gaps wing when the ball isn't in his hands. Operating as a lead facilitator at times for Texas powerhouse Duncanville alongside elite 2023 recruit Ron Holland, Black became a proven passer who plays a ball-moving style predicated on transition hit-aheads and heady pick-and-roll reads. He's not the most dynamic ball handler and is still evolving as a half-court scorer and perimeter shooter, which is what makes him an excellent fit alongside a guard like Nick Smith at Arkansas. Although his streaky spot shooting hampers him some when the ball isn't in his hands, Black proved during Nike Hoop Summit week that he's capable of filling a role by running the floor, moving off the ball, getting downhill off the catch and staying active on the offensive glass. He's also a well-rounded defender with the feet and feel to check multiple positions, even if he's not overly long with a 6-7 wingspan. As was the case for other 6-6, feel-based guards like Lonzo Ball before him, Black will have to prove he can make enough shots both off the catch and the dribble to keep the defense honest. He's also not the most offensively aggressive player. But scouts are likely to appreciate his versatility, feel and positional size, especially if he's able to play a major role on a talented Arkansas team that appears poised for another NCAA tournament run. -- ESPN ","The Magic have positioned themselves quite well after selecting Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner in the past two drafts, setting up to push for their first playoff berth since the COVID-shortened 2020 season. Entering this draft with two lottery picks in hand, Orlando has a range of available options in terms of pairing rookies together, as well as potentially moving around in trades. The Magic can create significant cap space this summer and are hoping to make a jump next season, making this a key juncture to add more young talent before potentially throwing open a competitive window. Player fit Black enters the NBA with a sneaky amount of upside, as a prospect who bloomed late, is still developing skill-wise, and has relied to this point on his size and excellent feel for the game. There's a lot of room for him to expand his offensive game - most importantly, he'll need to be able to knock down open shots - but provided his confidence and scoring ability keeps growing, Black can be the type of oversized playmaker teams covet. He's also one of the better defenders in the draft, with great balance and anticipation at his size, able to guard all over the perimeter and make an impact. Considering that skillset framework and how much he's improved in a relatively short time, Black could wind up as one of the best players in this draft. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Bilal Coulibaly",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"France","France",NA,NA,NA,"April 20, 2023 Coulibaly, whose parents are from Mali, stands 6-foot-8, 194 pounds with a 7-foot-2 wingspan. He is the third youngest player in the ESPN 100 at age 18 but is on a different trajectory from most prospects in this draft, being an almost complete unknown even in France a year ago after a late growth spurt that took him from 5-11 as a 16-year-old. Since last summer, Coulibaly has been on a steady ascent, having a strong showing with the French national team at the FIBA U18 European Championship and outdueling Bronny James in an exhibition game in Paris several weeks later in August by scoring 25 points, mostly in the second half, in a come-from-behind win. With his elite dimensions, Coulibaly's defensive potential is considerable, as he is regularly tasked with slowing down point guards and shows impressive quickness covering ground and contesting shots on the perimeter. Although not a consistent shooter, Coulibaly grew up a guard and retains many of those perimeter skills. -- Jonathan Givony ","The Wizards traded up to acquire this pick from the Pacers in order to select Coulibaly, confirming a growing leaguewide suspicion that he was Washington's target at No. 8. Sources suggested the Wizards were concerned about another team trading ahead of them to select him - Utah, sitting at No. 9, was particularly hot on Coulibaly's trail - and were aggressive in securing him at this spot. The Wizards dealt two second-round picks to the Pacers to ensure they got their man.Player fit Coulibaly's rise from bit player to essential playmaker of Victor Wembanyama's Metropolitans 92 team that made the French finals did wonders for his standing in the draft, catapulting him into lottery conversations and ultimately landing here. Still 18 years old at 6-foot-8 with a 7-foot-2.25 wingspan, Coulibaly's physical profile, versatile defense and room to grow make him a highly intriguing fit for the NBA game. While he's likely to require a year or two of seasoning, you can argue his long-term upside among the best in the draft, and as he learns to assert himself more on offense, there may be layers to his game he hasn't shown yet. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jarace Walker",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Houston","HOU",NA,NA,NA,"March 14, 2023  NBA scouts love that Walker elected to play at Houston under a demanding coach such as Kelvin Sampson, who doesn't typically reel in five-star recruits, showing that Walker isn't afraid to get pushed. He has had a productive season but still has some questions to answer regarding the extent of his skill level and just how high his ceiling is as an offensive player, something the NCAA tournament can hopefully shed light on. Walker's tremendous frame, length, defensive versatility and toughness give him a ready-made role he can step into early in his NBA career. He has shown progress this season with his perimeter shooting (36% from 3) but has been a mixed bag as a decision-maker and a shot-creator, all while shooting a disappointing 62% from the free throw line. After Walker has been tucked away in the American Athletic Conference, NBA executives will appreciate being able to watch him against a different caliber of competition in the NCAA tournament, as Houston hasn't played a top-25 opponent in more than three months.-- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 Walker is coming off an outstanding season at IMG Academy, emerging as a two-way force with impressive versatility while dropping flashes of ability as a midrange shooter, ball handler and passer that gives him significant room for growth long-term. He doesn't have great size for a power forward, standing just 6-7.5 in shoes, but makes up for that and then some with his huge 7-2 wingspan, chiseled frame and intriguing combination of power and explosiveness, which should allow him to even see some minutes as a small-ball center in the NBA. Walker is a highly competitive defender who shows the ability to slow down guards, wings and big men alike, being quick off his feet for blocks, and a force in the passing lanes thanks to his length. He's an inconsistent offensive player with questionable shooting mechanics and decision-making who nevertheless impacts the game in a plethora of ways, especially with his passing and ability to push the ball off the defensive glass. His physical style of play, outstanding demeanor and competitive spirit give him a high floor as a prospect. Making strides with his jumper could propel him firmly into top-10 candidacy. -- Jonathan Givony Jan. 19, 2021 Walker was up and down from a productivity and efficiency standpoint in three games but will always pique the interest of scouts -- even among bouts of inconsistency -- thanks to his outstanding physical tools and budding versatility on both ends of the floor. Standing 6-8 with a 230-pound frame and a near 7-2 wingspan, Walker already looks the part of a NBA forward. While not overly explosive in a traditional sense, Walker plays with unique pace and changes speeds fluidly with long strides, making him a graceful shot-creator when operating at his best. The next step in his offensive development will have to come with his jumper, which sports a slow release and an incredibly high arc, making him inconsistent throughout his career, as well as from the free throw line. Walker's defensive versatility does make up for that to an extent, as he plays with excellent intensity and shows a lot of versatility switching onto guards, wings and forwards, while being a real event creator getting in passing lanes, protecting the rim and crashing the glass. NBA scouts can afford to be patient with the 17-year-old Walker, who displays intriguing playmaking ability on both ends of the floor. His projection is highly dependent on finding more ways to put the ball in the basket efficiently, which may be easier with better spacing and less ball-handling responsibility. -- Jonathan Givony","The Wizards are preparing for a full rebuild under new president Michael Winger, and the Bradley Beal trade was the first domino to fall in that process. With the No. 8 pick, the Wizards sit in a position to grab whoever they view as the best long-term prospect available. The Wizards filled their long-term point guard hole by trading for Tyus Jones, but it's hard to assume much about Washington's roster moving forward with the understanding that more veterans could all be on the move. Player fit Walker is slightly undersized for a big man at a hair under 6-8 in shoes, but more than makes up for that with a 7-2.5 wingspan and chiseled 249-pound frame. His tools, combined with his mobility and toughness give him a chance to be one of the best and most versatile defenders in this class - allowing him to carve out a role early in his NBA career. He's shown flashes of perimeter shooting and passing that are highly intriguing. Although his overall offensive polish, especially as a ball handler, is still a major work in progress since he's not the most fluid or naturally skillful player around. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Taylor Hendricks",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UCF","UCF",NA,NA,NA,"March 9, 2023 UCF showed some early promise but ultimately faded, finished 8-10 in AAC play and fell to the No. 7 seed in the AAC conference tournament. It now faces the daunting task of winning four games in four days to prolong its season. It's tough to lay much blame for that on Hendricks, who has been easily one of the most productive (and consistent) freshmen in college basketball, giving him a clear case for lottery consideration as an explosive, energetic, 6-9 multipositional defender who is shooting 42% from 3. Unlike some surprise under-the-radar underclassmen, Hendricks' productivity only increased as the season moved on, even against better competition that he mostly excelled against. Finishing on a strong note would be helpful, as a handful of executives might be getting their first live look at Hendricks this weekend, but his body of work is strong after 30 games. -- Jonathan Givony Dec. 27, 2022 Hendricks has emerged as one of the most productive freshmen in college basketball, leading UCF in scoring at 15.3 points per game while shooting 46% from 3. At 6-foot-9 with long arms and a strong combination of mobility and explosiveness, he has a clear NBA physical profile and brings coveted floor spacing and high-energy defense, and crashes the offensive glass. Hendricks has some questions to answer: His two worst games have come against the best teams UCF has faced in Miami and Missouri -- and he doesn't appear to be much of a shot-creator or passer, while at times the game moves too fast for him on both ends. Games against the likes of Houston and Memphis will be studied closely by NBA executives in the coming weeks. Still, Hendricks' combination of physical tools, intensity, perimeter shooting and potential defensive versatility is highly intriguing, especially considering he just turned 19 a month ago. -- Jonathan Givony","The Jazz are in one of the NBA's most enviable positions, amassing a hoard of draft picks in the Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert trades, a sparkling clean cap sheet, and two major building blocks in Lauri Markkanen and Walker Kessler, who they shrewdly acquired in those aforementioned trades. Despite the franchise's rosy outlook, there's still considerable work to do in filling out the roster, particularly the backcourt's playmaking, shooting and scoring punch to return to the playoffs after missing the postseason for the first time in seven years. The team was much feistier under highly regarded coach Will Hardy than anyone thought they would be, which quickly took them out of the running for a top pick. The front office will need to continue to take swings to add star power to ensure they don't get stuck in a middle-ground of being competitive enough to avoid drafting high, but not good enough to win a playoff series. Player fit Hendricks fits a clear mold NBA teams are seeking as a 6-9 1/2 power forward with impressive defensive versatility, finishing prowess and perimeter shooting, converting 39% of his 3-pointers on the season. He plays exceptionally hard, can protect the rim or switch onto smaller players, knows his limitations, and has significant upside to grow into as his 214-pound frame fills out. NBA teams want to see his passing, ballhandling and all-around feel for the game improve to be more than just an excellent role player. But at 19 years old, and with the impressive trajectory he's on, it's hard to put a ceiling on his potential. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Cason Wallace",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kentucky","UK",NA,NA,NA,"March 20, 2023 Kentucky's season ended in disappointment in a hard-fought loss to Kansas State, but it's hard to blame their star freshman point guard. Wallace had 21 points on 9-for-11 shooting with seven rebounds, four assists and two steals. Wallace was a perfect 7-for-7 (15 points) in the second half, coming up repeatedly with big baskets and almost always making the right play passing ahead, driving and dishing and looking under control. He was unlucky to see his teammates go 3-for-19 from 3, with at least six open 3-point looks created by Wallace that weren't converted, a major reason Kentucky lost. Wallace's shot creation and aggressiveness left something to be desired at times this season, but he was able to get inside the paint against Kansas State in transition and out of pick and roll, hitting tough floaters and layups through contact going both left or right. He committed four turnovers in the first 10 minutes, partially a product of trying to navigate Kentucky's lack of spacing, but played a pretty clean game otherwise. His defense, long considered his calling card, was vividly evident Sunday, as he came up with two pick-six steals for layups, fought over screens aggressively and had some big-time rebounds in traffic while putting his body on the line. Wallace will be disappointed not to advance past the first round of the NCAA tournament and there are some holes that can be nitpicked in his game with his lack of scoring production and his occasional struggles with efficiency. However, Wallace had a strong freshman year that will serve him well developmentally after being forced to shoulder a huge offensive load under extreme pressure for much of the season and now looks like a strong top-10 prospect. -- Jonathan GivonyMarch 14, 2023 There's a lot to like about what Wallace brings in terms of his toughness, feel for the game, spot shooting, unselfishness and defensive versatility, giving him a pretty high floor as a prospect. NBA teams are still trying to get a better read on just how high his ceiling is and if he projects as a starting-caliber point guard who can keep defenses honest with his scoring ability, as he isn't the most explosive or creative guard and might be better suited in a secondary role. Injuries to himself and teammates have forced Wallace into different roles and greater responsibility than he is likely comfortable shouldering at this stage, leading to a pretty inconsistent showing in SEC play. Wallace will be under significant pressure to help Kentucky advance past the first weekend of the NCAA tournament, as the Wildcats have failed to win a tournament game in four years.-- Jonathan Givony Nov. 17, 2022  Wallace had a strong showing at the Champions Classic, posting 14 points, eight steals, five rebounds and five assists in Kentucky's double-overtime loss. Most notable were the steals, showing outstanding physicality, awareness, intensity and instincts in one-on-one situations, jumping passing lanes, and digging down from the weakside, leading to several run-out baskets. Wallace has a knack for anticipating opponents' passes and pre-rotating to deny the ball or sneaking in for timely swipe-downs to create turnovers. He's also much stronger than at first glance, being able to absorb blows from bigger players and still contain them off the dribble on the perimeter. He's an excellent rebounder and had one awesome block rotating to protect the rim and erase a sure-fire dunk. Offensively, Wallace hit a pair of smooth-looking spot-up 3-pointers and did a nice job of probing with the ball and dishing to open teammates. He's Kentucky's most reliable post-entry passer, often tasked with feeding forward Oscar Tshiebwe in the paint and generally doing a good job of getting the ball where it needs to be in the half-court. His limitations as a creator in the half-court were also evident, as he's not the most dynamic ball handler or explosive driver and struggles to put pressure on the rim, often being forced to settle for low-percentage floaters and pull-ups from difficult vantage points inside the arc. He ran out of gas late in the game and made some bad decisions when Kentucky desperately needed someone to step up and make a play off the dribble down the stretch. Navigating Kentucky's lack of spacing will likely be an issue all season with the number of non-shooters and non-passers coach John Calipari has assembled once again, so how Wallace evolves as a half-court creator will likely play a key role in how he's viewed as a prospect on draft night. Wallace clearly has a high floor as a prospect with his lockdown defensive prowess, toughness, feel for the game, ability to make open shots and how he impacts winning. Scouts will try to get a better feel for his offensive ceiling as the season moves on. -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 Wallace was one of the best defenders in the high school game, a long-armed combo guard with outstanding toughness, intensity and instincts getting in passing lanes, chasing down blocks and crashing the glass energetically. He made major strides over the past year with his playmaking ability and perimeter shooting, showing good mechanics and range on his pull-up jumper, even if he's still on the streaky side offensively. He is still developing as a shot creator, but has nice fluidity operating at different speeds and plays an unselfish style that has helped him win plenty of games everywhere he has been. Wallace doesn't blow you away with his skill level or explosiveness currently and still has some questions to answer regarding his ability to transition to the point guard position full-time as his size suggests suits him. Teams will appreciate the competitiveness, versatility and businesslike approach he brings, but productivity will ultimately help determine how high he ends up being picked. -- Jonathan Givony","The Thunder traded up from No. 12 to No. 10 with the Mavericks to select Wallace, a player they quietly coveted. With Orlando's No. 11 pick viewed as a potential trade spot, Oklahoma City was aggressive in trading up to secure him, ensuring another team couldn't move in front.Player fit Wallace has ideal size and length for a guard at 6-4 in shoes with a 6-8.5 wingspan and a 195-pound frame that should fill out nicely in time. His calling card in the NBA revolves around his toughness and defensive versatility, as he consistently hawked the point of attack for Kentucky, generated turnovers in bunches, and showed the ability to guard bigger and smaller players. Wallace's offensive aggressiveness was a mixed bag at times. But he showed enough potential as a perimeter shooter (35% 3P%) and passer to feel comfortable projecting improvement here as his shot creation and finishing evolves. There's a market for combo guards in this mold who can change the pace of a game defensively and offer enough shooting and unselfishness to serve as complementary options operating alongside stars. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jett Howard",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Michigan","MICH",NA,NA,NA,"March 9, 2023 Two Big Ten tournament wins over Rutgers and Purdue on Thursday and Friday seem to be needed to give Michigan any hope of earning a spot in the NCAA tournament. Howard, in particular, could benefit from a strong end to the season to solidify his standing with NBA teams, as he has struggled at times in Big Ten action, shooting just 42% from 2-point range in 17 conference games while not bringing enough as a rebounder or defender to compensate for his inability to create efficient offense inside the arc. Howard has still flashed what makes him an intriguing NBA prospect as a 6-8 wing with dynamic shooting ability and range, ability to pull up off the dribble and impressive vision passing on the move, but he has been somewhat passive inserting himself into games. His exceptionally poor playmaking numbers defensively (0.5 steals, 0.9 blocks, 3.6 rebounds per 40) are certain to hurt him with NBA analytics models. Some teams wonder, however, whether he will return to school for his sophomore season considering his father, Juwan, is his coach and he wasn't initially considered a one-and-done candidate. Missing the NCAA tournament could accelerate that process, and potentially cause teammates Bufkin and Hunter Dickinson to consider doing the same. -- Jonathan Givony Dec. 1, 2022 Although he didn't start the season considered a surefire one-and-done, Howard has propelled firmly into lottery consideration early on with his excellent play at Michigan, already looking like one of the most versatile shot-makers in college basketball while demonstrating the ability to do more than that. Howard's three 3-pointers made per game trails only Miller among college freshmen, and he's hitting 44% of his attempts despite a steady diet of pullups and stepbacks while showing the ability to shoot running off screens. Howard is already an NBA-level shooter, especially considering his excellent size (6-8) and 215-pound frame, which has also helped him convert an outstanding 65% of his 2-point attempts. He's demonstrated real versatility pushing in the open floor, scoring with his back to the basket, attacking closeouts and operating out of pick-and-roll. Despite being tasked with a good amount of shot-creation responsibility, Howard has turned the ball over only six times while accruing 17 assists in 217 minutes, mostly operating on the move driving and dishing or finding guys over the top out of ball screens. The next step for Howard will come on the defensive end. He's looked fairly apathetic at times this season, especially off the ball, where he tends to lose his focus and fall asleep, giving up too many easy baskets due to late reactions and poor technique. Analytics models will ding Howard for the paltry number of steals (two) and rebounds (15) he's generated so far, a product of his lack of intensity, but he has shown flashes of providing a little more fight in one-on-one situations as getting over screens and recovering for blocks (11), indicating he has room to improve. NBA teams are looking for 6-8 wings who can handle, pass and shoot in a variety of ways, and Howard's bloodlines as the son of an NBA All-Star in Juwan Howard certainly won't hurt. Since he plays for his father at Michigan, NBA teams aren't sure how much of a rush Howard will be in to leave college, but if he continues to produce at the Big Ten level, it might be difficult to pass up the opportunity to be a very high draft pick.-- Jonathan Givony ","Rival teams weren't sure if the Magic, one of the youngest teams in the NBA, would be looking to roster a second lottery pick on top of their already-sizeable stable of talent. Ultimately, the depth of this draft class was too enticing for the franchise to pass up, causing them to stand pat at No. 11. Player fit Howard started off hot at Michigan, then battled nagging ankle problems for much of the season, losing the lottery-level buzz, but still projecting as a mid-to-late first-rounder on the strength of his jump shot. As the son of longtime NBA vet Juwan Howard, Jett's game is quite different, with projectable size and consistent shooting mechanics on the wing, as well as some room to add to his game off the dribble and defensively. There's typically a place for tall, talented shot-making wings in the NBA, however, there's some downside if Howard doesn't make shots at the level his draft slot suggests he should. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Dereck Lively II",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Duke","DUKE",NA,NA,NA,"March 20, 2023 Lively scored just four points in 65 minutes of NCAA tournament action, failing to attempt a single shot against Tennessee. That's partially due to his limitations offensively as well as Duke's own struggles with ball movement versus a stout Vols defense. Sporting the lowest usage percentage (11.6%) of any collegiate player in our top 100, with what would be the lowest usage rate of a draft pick in the past 20-plus years, Lively doesn't have much to offer outside of being spoon-fed dunks at just 5.2 PPG.  He does bring exceptional mobility covering ground on the perimeter and instincts as a rim-protector with his 7-3 1/2 wingspan and 9-4 standing reach. He's the No. 1 shot-blocker among projected draft picks by a wide margin and has improved his ability to show or switch on ball-screens, giving him a ready-made role in the NBA with room to grow as his frame fills out. Lively is a project offensively and will need to improve his strength and physicality to hold his own on both ends of the floor. But he is only 19 years old, has improved all season and has the type of upside a patient team could certainly be interested in developing should he enter the draft.-- Jonathan Givony March 14, 2023 Lively lost his spot in Duke's starting lineup after a poor start but rebounded as the season moved on, and he is playing his best basketball as of late, emerging as the best shot-blocker in college basketball. Lively is still not the most prolific scorer but has proved to be an excellent finisher around the basket as well as a solid passer and offensive rebounder, finding ways to contribute to Duke's recent strong play without needing touches. Lively's lack of strength, struggles with foul trouble and still-developing physicality and skill level make him more of a long-term prospect in this draft, potentially relegating him to a late first-round option. He could help himself by helping Duke advance past the first weekend and showing that he is more ready to contribute than previously thought.-- Jonathan Givony Feb. 4, 2023 Lively got off to a slow start after missing time in the preseason with a calf injury but is currently playing his best basketball of the season. The 7-2 18-year-old needed time to adjust to the physicality and speed of the college game, but he is starting to do a better job of asserting himself on both ends of the floor. Defensively, he's an absolute difference-maker with his mobility, timing and length, coming up with 12 blocks in his past 77 minutes of action and showing nice potential switching onto guards on the perimeter and containing off the bounce. He has been far more aggressive, using his size and reach to crash the offensive glass, and is a terrific vertical target rolling to the rim or cutting off the ball, averaging one dunk for every 11 minutes of action he sees, higher than any projected draft pick. He has shown some flashes of passing ability and made his first 3-pointer of the season last week against Georgia Tech. Lively's frame is still a major work in progress, he's still very foul-prone and he is not the presence you might expect on the defensive glass or offensively outside of being spoon-fed for dunks, some of the reasons his stock dropped to the end of the first round after his slow start. Ranking second to last in per-minute scoring among college prospects in our Top 100, he would likely benefit from a second season at Duke, similar to how his predecessor Mark Williams needed time to hit the ground running. Progressing over the next six weeks and showing he's not as far away as initially feared from playing in a real NBA game is certainly possible, as he'll have a huge platform at his disposal with many high-profile games along with the ACC and NCAA tournaments. -- Jonathan Givony Nov. 17, 2022  After missing nearly a month of action with a calf injury that forced him to miss several scrimmages and Duke's regular season opener, it shouldn't be a major surprise that Lively didn't look ready to make an impact against the defending national champions. His only offense came on a pair of well-timed putback dunks. He struggled to be in the right spots defensively -- looking a step-slow -- particularly guarding pick and roll. Lively's thin frame allowed Kansas to screen him out of the action repeatedly and nullify his best attribute, rim-protection prowess. He got scored on around the basket several times even when he was in position to make a play, most glaringly giving up a crucial and-one allowing a non-scoring guard, Dajuan Harris Jr., to catch and finish a bounce pass in rhythm as Lively was showing too high up on a screen. Duke is going to need Lively to get up to speed quickly as they embark on a crucial trip to Portland for the PK-85 next week. -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 The No. 1 player in his high school class, Lively has an incredibly high floor as a fluid, rangy two-way big who offers a lot of the same things scouts loved about Evan Mobley at a young age. Standing 7-1 in shoes with a 9-4 standing reach, Lively's clear NBA skill is his shot-blocking as he displays excellent timing and instincts, putting a lid on the rim. He's also incredibly vocal in pick-and-roll, calling out coverages, bringing the type of personality NBA coaches like from a young big and even showing the ability to step out and switch. Lively is also a lob threat who has the court sense and feel to play out of the short roll as a playmaker. On the flip side, Lively has a high center of gravity and struggles a bit to play through contact offensively -- particularly as a finisher -- at this stage of his physical development. While he has shown shooting potential out to 3, that hasn't quite materialized in a game setting consistently yet, which isn't uncommon for teenage bigs. Even with his vocal nature, he's not the most naturally aggressive player yet. With that said, Lively looks like a clear NBA starter with the approach and skill potential to develop into even more than that, especially after what should be a competitive freshman campaign on a loaded Blue Devils team. Lively earns rave reviews off the court, and is the type of two-way connector who should be able to impact winning in a big way in the ACC. With Myles Turner a free agent after next season, the Pacers would have to be thrilled to land the best non-Wembanyama 7-footer in the draft and a franchise center. -- ESPN Jan. 21, 2022 Lively looks like the early favorite to finish as the No. 1 player in the 2022 high school class, and for good reason. At 7-foot-1, with a 9-foot-2 standing reach, he offers exceptional mobility covering ground fluidly and getting off his feet with incredible ease for dunks and blocks, making him an absolute force defensively. He averaged 6.2 blocks per 40 minutes at the Nike EYBL last summer on the team that won the championship, the fifth-best rate in the competition's history. He's also highly skilled as a passer and already shows the ability to step out and hit 3-pointers with increasingly polished shooting mechanics, giving him a modern element to his game that all big-man prospects need, to go along with his rim-running, lob-catching, rim-protecting and pick-and-roll-switching prowess. Also not considered a consensus five-star prospect until last summer, the main holdup for Lively to enter the No. 1 pick conversation, where his talent suggests he belongs, is his lack of productivity at the high school level. In a high-profile matchup with Gill St. Bernard's at the Hoophall Classic in Springfield, Massachusetts, last weekend, he didn't attempt a field goal until well into the second half, and finished the game with only five points (on 2-for-8 shooting) despite boasting at least a 6-inch height advantage on the next-tallest player on the floor at all times. He has been criticized for his lack of physicality and alpha mentality, mirroring some of the same things we heard about Mobley at the same stage but to an even more extreme degree. We've learned over the years not to be too much of a prisoner of the moment when it comes to evaluating late-blooming, 17-year-old 7-footers in Lively's mold, but how he evolves in the toughness and productivity departments as the season progresses at Duke will be important. -- Jonathan Givony ","The Thunder traded up from No. 12 to No. 10 here with the Mavericks to select Cason Wallace, a player they quietly coveted. With Orlando's No. 11 pick viewed as a potential trade spot, Oklahoma City was aggressive in trading up to secure him, ensuring that another team couldn't move in front of them. Player fit Lively has gradually built a good case for himself as the top non-Wembanyama rim protector in a draft thin on centers. He offers excellent measurables and above-average mobility at 7-2, made significant strides after initially struggling to adjust at Duke, and capped it off with a positive pre-draft process that reminded teams why he was such a highly regarded recruit. It's hard to find players his size and while Lively has quite a bit to improve upon in all areas, he should be able to impact games defensively, run the floor, and finish plays at a high level. Most of his impact will come from protecting the paint, but there aren't that many prospects that come along in his mold that also have his type of physical abilities. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Gradey Dick",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kansas","KU",NA,NA,NA,"March 20, 2023 After an outstanding opening-round performance against No. 16 seed Howard (19 points, 11 rebounds, five assists), Dick's impact was far more muted in a disappointing upset loss to No. 8 seed Arkansas, scoring seven points on 3-for-9 shooting. He showed good activity and smarts crashing the glass and competing defensively, but showed his strength, length and experience limitations on several occasions, especially guarding the smaller Davonte Davis on switches and being unable to keep him off his stronger left hand. Dick has been solid on that end this season but wasn't able to break free for open shots and provide the coveted shot-making ability that makes him such an appealing NBA prospect, being hounded on and off the ball by Arkansas' defense and struggling to attack closeouts effectively. Dick's freshman season was overwhelmingly positive, as he hit 40% of his 3-pointers and was able to show enough competence in other areas to not project as just a one-dimensional specialist in the NBA. His size, high skill level, feel for the game, competitiveness and youth at 19 years old gives Dick a very high floor in the modern game and there are reasons to believe he'll continue to develop his offensive versatility long-term.-- Jonathan GivonyMarch 14, 2023 It's hard to find NBA scouts who don't like the tremendous perimeter shooting ability, defensive competitiveness, feel for the game and all-around consistency Dick offers, making him widely viewed as one of the ""safer"" prospects in this class. He has been just as effective against top-tier competition as against lesser teams, has shown growth as the season has moved on and has rarely looked overwhelmed on either end of the floor. There's an opening for Dick to enter a different tier from high-floor, role-playing prospect to coveted top-10 caliber pick over the next three weeks if he can help guide Kansas to the Final Four and potentially cut the nets down for the second year in a row.-- Jonathan Givony Nov. 17, 2022  No freshman had a more impressive season debut than Kansas forward Dick -- posting 23 points in 31 minutes in a blowout win over Omaha with several eye-opening dunks, deep 3s off-movement and strong defensive possessions on and off the ball. The Champions Classic would present a much higher level of competition, though, so many scouts were curious to see how that would translate to a tough matchup with Duke. Translate it did, as Dick was the best player on the court in several stretches, most notably down the stretch where he scored seven consecutive points to ice the game for the Jayhawks. Dick proved to be more than just an outstanding shooter (43% for 3 on the season so far), making several outstanding cuts and acrobatic finishes in this game, hitting a mid-range pull-up jumper attacking a closeout, and leaking out intelligently in transition for a tough finish through contact. He continued to make a strong impression defensively, heating up the ball in the backcourt, coming up with deflections, and drawing an offensive foul locking up Tyrese Proctor one-on-one. While not the strongest, longest or rangiest defender, Dick has a great foundation to build off with the effort level he provides, his anticipation skills off the ball and the toughness he displays. Dick is displaying a great deal of calmness and confidence you wouldn't necessarily expect from an 18-year-old, something that bodes well for the role he's projected to play in the NBA. It's very early in the season, but there aren't many teams in the NBA who won't be interested in adding a 6-7 dead-eye shooter with a strong feel for the game who looks capable of holding his own defensively. -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 Dick fits an obvious mold the NBA is actively seeking as a 6-7 wing who made 47% of his 3-pointers this season, on significant volume, per Synergy. The Jayhawk-to-be shows the ability to rise up beautifully off screens, pull up in transition or execute step-backs in small doses, while being nearly automatic spacing the floors from the corner. While known for his jumper, he shows some ability to do more than that, as he has a good feel for the game and some explosiveness filling lanes in transition, attacking closeouts and going out of his area for rebounds on occasion. His defense improved significantly over his high school career, as he shows good activity, smarts and competitiveness, but he does have plenty to prove in this area with his thin frame and lack of length and physicality. Kansas hasn't had a one-and-done player since Josh Jackson in 2017, so it remains to be seen how much of a fast track Dick will be on with the defending national champions. --Jonathan Givony ","After missing the playoffs for the second time in three years, the Raptors are in an interesting position. Despite being just four years removed from winning a championship, they had a coaching change this off-season and are potentially on the verge of significant roster changes depending on which direction the front office elects to go. Scottie Barnes didn't take the jump some hoped after his rookie of the year campaign last season, and there are questions about how high this team's ceiling is with Pascal Siakam spearheading the offense. The backcourt may be in line for an overhaul with Fred VanVleet and Gary Trent entering free agency, and the team will be looking to significantly improve their spacing by adding much-needed shooting after ranking among the league-worst in that department. Player fit Gradey Dick is arguably the best perimeter shooter in this draft, a 6-7.5 wing with a sturdy frame, a high skill level, a solid feel for the game, and competitiveness and swagger that should make him a plug-and-play option early in his career. He has ideal shooting mechanics and footwork relocating for open looks, pulling up off the bounce and even coming off screens in small doses. Dick's footspeed defensively will be tested by more explosive opponents, and he'll need to continue to improve as a passer and finisher to become a higher usage option. But at 19 years old, there's quite a bit to like about his outlook and profile, which almost every team in the NBA could use to some extent.-- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jordan Hawkins",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UConn","CONN",NA,NA,NA,"March 27, 2023 Hawkins took his game to another level in the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight, dropping 44 points on 25 field goal attempts shooting 9-for-19 (47%) for 3. Gonzaga failed to slow Hawkins down with him running off screens, ducking behind handoffs, making side-step 3-pointers and hitting spot-ups with a quick release and exceptional footwork. He has a coveted skill set he can hang his hat on from Day 1 in the NBA. In the game against Arkansas, Hawkins showed there's more to his play than ""just"" being a sniper, as he got downhill attacking overplays, sloppy closeouts, handoffs and curls with both his left and right hand, going inside the arc and drawing nine free throw attempts. He's shooting 44% inside the arc with more turnovers than assists, and although improved, doesn't offer as much resistance defensively with his light frame, limiting his ceiling. Nevertheless, Hawkins is the plug-and-play scorer many playoff teams seek, and the 20-year-old has additional versatility and upside left with more explosiveness than one would guess at first glance.-- Jonathan Givony March 20, 2023 Hawkins was quiet in the first halves of both games UConn won last weekend, going scoreless in 21 total minutes. But the shooting guard showed how quickly his shot-making can turn a game by scoring a combined 25 points in 26 minutes (7-for-8 from 3) in second halves versus Iona and Saint Mary's. Hawkins' game revolves heavily around his jumper, but the way he can manufacture looks by running off screens, pulling up off the dribble or hitting tough stepbacks makes him someone defenses need to account for. His defensive lapses, average ball-handling ability and tendency to disappear for stretches might put somewhat of a ceiling on how high he hears his name called, but every NBA team is looking for instant offense in Hawkins' mold and he can continue to help his standing in a prospect-laden matchup next weekend against Nick Smith Jr., Anthony Black and Arkansas in Las Vegas on Thursday. -- Jonathan Givony March 14, 2023 Hawkins is in the midst of a breakout sophomore season that won him first-team All-Big East honors. He is one of the most prolific shooters in this draft class, blessed with elite footwork and body control while getting into his jump shot with picture-perfect mechanics rising up out of handoffs, pulling up off the dribble or running off screens. Slowing Hawkins down will be a major focal point for opposing teams in the NCAA tournament; and finding ways to stay aggressive and utilize the threat of his jumper to create good looks inside the arc for himself and others is the next step in his evolution offensively. His defense, while improved, is still inconsistent, as well, as his intensity (on both ends) fluctuates at times, something NBA teams will want to see ramp up as the spotlight brightens.-- Jonathan Givony ","The Pelicans have been all over the rumor mill leading into draft night, but a potential move into the top three of the draft appeared to hang on their willingness to part with Brandon Ingram or Zion Williamson. Such a move never materialized, and after exploring moving around elsewhere in the draft, New Orleans stayed in a spot to pick the best talent available at No. 14. Player fit Hawkins played a major part in UConn's championship run and saw his draft stock steadily climb as a result, having showcased himself as arguably the draft's top shooter, particularly running off of screens. While he can sometimes be slapped with the specialist label, Hawkins is more athletic than your typical pure 3-point shooter and plays with a good level of toughness, endearing him to teams as a potential plug-and-play option. The scarcity of true, dynamic movement shooters like Hawkins helped make him an appealing option in this part of the draft, and there's certainly upside as he refines that skill set.-- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Kobe Bufkin",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Michigan","MICH",NA,NA,NA,"March 9, 2023 Bufkin has taken his game to another level over the past 10 games, ramping up his aggressiveness significantly, improving his perimeter shooting (45% 3P%) and emerging as one of the most disruptive defenders in the Big Ten. With his outstanding open-court speed and increasing comfort as a ball handler, decision-maker and pull-up shooter in the half court -- and because he's the same age or younger than many freshmen projected to be one-and-done -- there's a lot to like about Bufkin's long-term outlook. For Michigan to prolong its season, it'll need Bufkin to continue to attack defenses as relentlessly as he has over the past two-plus months. Regardless of how the season ends, teams are certain to be interested in what Bufkin elects to do this spring despite his thin frame and still-developing playmaking ability. -- Jonathan Givony","The Hawks went through a somewhat tumultuous season undergoing changes in both the front office and coaching staff. They have some difficult decisions ahead regarding the future of Trae Young and their increasingly difficult cap situation, which may see them bump up against the new CBA's second apron with pending extensions for Dejounte Murray, Onyeka Okongwu and others. The team explored the trade market for John Collins, Clint Capela and De'Andre Hunter in the lead-up to the draft, and ultimately decided to stand pat for what promises to be an important summer in store. Player fit Bufkin's rise from the fringes of the draft radar all the way into the lottery has been an exciting story for those watching closely -- after struggling to adjust in his first year at Michigan, his game took flight as a sophomore still young for his class. He plays with great energy on both ends of the floor and has flashed the ability to score at all three levels. Most scouts agree his upside lies in whether he can develop into a point guard, where his size and quickness should give him an advantage, but there are also reasonable scenarios where Bufkin plays more of a supporting role than a lead playmaker. In a draft full of guards who may be best-suited combos, he offers arguably the most upside to develop into more than that.-- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Keyonte George",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Baylor","BAY",NA,NA,NA,"March 20, 2023 George didn't have a great NCAA tournament weekend, shooting a combined 3-for-19 from the field and bowing out in the round of 32 with a loss to Creighton on Sunday. His effectiveness and efficiency really ebbed and flowed over the last two months and his questionable shot selection and defensive lapses caused him to spend more time on the bench than you would expect this last weekend. George wasn't a great fit on either end of the floor with Baylor's undersize scoring guards -- Adam Flagler and LJ Cryer -- as each of them need the ball to be effective, live off a steady diet of difficult shots and lack length in a backcourt that struggled to get stops all season. George made some progress defensively this season and even had some moments against the Bluejays by stepping in for a charge and forcing opponents into tough pull-ups. But his inability to navigate screens, propensity for flying on every fake and lapses off the ball made it tough for George as he failed to get stops for Baylor in an up-tempo game featuring impressive shot-making from Creighton's guards. George's scoring instincts and ability to hit pull-up jumpers and make pocket passes out of pick and roll give him a high floor as a strongly built 6-4 combo guard. He didn't do enough late in the season to solidify himself in mid-lottery conversations but still has an obvious niche he can fill as a bucket-getter with upside to grow into.-- Jonathan GivonyMarch 14, 2023 George spearheads arguably the most potent offense in college basketball, giving clear insight into what his role projects as at the NBA level. He is dynamic while changing speeds out of ball screens, has impressive creativity finding teammates off a live dribble and exhibits excellent footwork, body control and skill rising up in short-range and midrange spots -- being one of the better off-the-dribble shooters in this draft class. The game clearly comes easily for George, who has the scoring instincts and versatility every NBA team covets. George has struggled at times with his decision-making and efficiency against better competition, not to mention his defense, which is not the strength of his game due to his average physical tools and intensity. He is shooting just 41% for 2 and 33% for 3 against top-50 competition, per Bart Torvik. Showing he can play winning basketball on both ends of the floor when the stakes are at their highest in the NCAA tournament could propel him more firmly into mid-lottery conversations as one of the first collegiate prospects to hear his name called on draft night.-- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 One of the best scorers in this class with an impressive resume coming out of IMG Academy, the strong-framed 6-4, 220-pound guard is a big-time shot-maker from 3 with the type of shooting versatility NBA teams covet. Although they're different in terms of height and physicality, the success of a shot-making guard like Jordan Poole certainly helps boost George's intrigue, as he's a microwave scorer who can catch fire out of a variety of different actions, rising into highly contested jumpers like few prospects in his class. While more scorer than point guard and still improving as a decision-maker, George has shown glimpses of playmaking potential, threading the needle with left-handed passes in transition that suggest he'll be capable of playing some minutes on the ball down the road, especially after a year of seasoning with a Baylor program that generally has success with multiple-guard lineups. George showed glimpses of competitiveness on the defensive end during the high school all-star circuit as well, although his motor fluctuated quite a bit during his high school career, an area that will surely be challenged in Waco, Texas. George will also benefit from adding more ways to impact the game when his shot isn't falling, especially considering the type of tough shots he tends to take. More powerful than shifty and not overly long, George continuing to improve as a passer, ball handler and finisher will make the 18-year-old an even tougher cover in the Big 12. Whether it's Poole, Cam Thomas or a star like Bradley Beal, there is no shortage of players similar to George finding success in the NBA. -- ESPN Jan. 21, 2022 George might be the most skilled scorer in the class, a thick-framed Eric Gordon type at 6-4 with a healthy ability to put the ball in the basket. He has gained some bad weight this season despite joining one of the most renowned strength and conditioning programs in the country at IMG, but he should be able to get in better shape at Baylor. George's ability to get downhill, finish around the basket, make shots from all over the floor, create for others in small doses and increasingly defend with energy (a relatively new development) gives him a great framework to build off. Being efficient with his shot selection and decision-making, bringing consistent intensity and playing more of a team game and winning style will be the things scouts want to see more of from him, as he's not blessed with elite physical tools in terms of size, length or explosiveness to compensate. -- Jonathan Givony Jan. 19, 2021 George's team only played twice at this event, both losses, but proved to be one of the more gifted scorers in attendance, averaging a cool 26 points per game. It's easy to see what makes him so highly regarded on first glance, as he has a natural pace to his game, changing speeds smoothly, being quick off his feet for explosive finishes and showing an impressive knack for putting the ball in the basket. He can make jumpers with his feet set or off the dribble, sometimes from well beyond the arc, showing soft touch and deep range that gives him excellent shot-making potential even coming off screens. Still figuring out what separates a good shot from a bad one, George can create for others but is at an early stage of development as far as his decision-making goes, being wildly inconsistent from possession to possession. His defensive intensity fluctuates as well, even if he has quick feet, a strong frame, good instincts and the ability to make plays getting in passing lanes or even blocking shots. Being more attentive off the ball -- and showing better technique on it -- could help him significantly in the long-term, even if his average size and length aren't ideal projecting long-term. George just turned 17. The fact that he already shows explosive athleticism, a fairly dynamic jump-shot and the ability to affect the game in several ways is a good sign for his future, especially if he continues to grow. -- Jonathan Givony ","Holding three first-round picks in different parts of the draft, the Jazz are one of the more interesting actors in the 2023 draft, capable of going in several directions. If they keep their picks, what they do at No. 16 will undoubtedly be influenced by who they take at No. 9, as they put pieces in place for what could be a somewhat quick rebuild thanks to the development of Lauri Markkanen and Walker Kessler. Player fit Entering draft night, George looked like a candidate to fall a bit, due in part to the large group of guards in the Nos. 10-20 range. He's a skilled offensive player with excellent scoring instincts, particularly for his age, and offers some nice shot-creation upside in the backcourt moving forward. However, George's contributions in other areas often left something to be desired, as his defensive awareness is sometimes subpar, and his decision-making can be a bit too shot-happy at times. There's a lot of room for growth, but also a chance he winds up as a somewhat replaceable, undersized two-guard. At this point in the draft, he's a solid investment and could develop into a useful rotation player and work up from there.-- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jalen Hood-Schifino",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Indiana","IU",NA,NA,NA,"March 20, 2023 Hood-Schifino showed what intrigues NBA scouts with his terrific size, live-dribble passing and shot-making, but had a poor showing overall on Sunday. In what's likely his last game for Indiana, Hood-Schifino was 8-for-22 from the field with three assists and three turnovers in a blowout loss to Miami. Hood-Schifino started off the game ice-cold from the perimeter, got beat repeatedly off the dribble and had sloppy turnovers, forcing the Hoosiers to play catch-up. He hit three difficult pull-up 3s at one key juncture to try and keep Indiana in the game, but couldn't get enough stops due to some off-ball lapses and turnovers at key moments. This was still a successful season for Hood-Schifino, who stepped into a key role as Indiana's lone ball-handler outside of center Trayce Jackson-Davis due to starting point guard Xavier Johnson's broken foot, giving him plenty of freedom and confidence to show off his significant talent as a passer and off the dribble shooter. NBA teams are still getting a handle on how quickly the home run hitter will be able to contribute to winning in a more compact role and how long it might take to get him to play with better consistency, but there's little doubt that Hood-Schifino's upside is one of the highest of any guard in this year's draft.-- Jonathan Givony March 14, 2023 At his best, Hood-Schifino looks like a potential top-10 recruit as the type of big, ballhandling guard with versatile shot-making prowess, live-dribble playmaking creativity and defensive toughness every NBA team is seeking, especially at 6-foot-5 with a strong frame and a 6-foot-10 wingspan. It's been a roller coaster of a season for him, though, with extremely impressive highs mixed with concerning bouts of poor shot selection, decision-making, interior finishing and defensive lapses that have led to a wide array of opinions for where he might ultimately be selected. Armed with a No. 4 seed, Indiana is in a position to make its deepest NCAA tournament run since 2016, where it made the Sweet 16, and possibly further.-- Jonathan Givony Feb. 4, 2023 Hood-Schifino is having a roller coaster ride of a season, with flashes of high-level lottery talent interspersed with some real stinkers that scream the need for a second year in school. Catch him on the right night -- Big Ten games against Ohio State, Northwestern and Iowa, where he averaged 26 points and five assists per game on a scorching 16-for-24 from beyond the arc -- and you're looking at one of the most talented freshmen in college basketball; a 6-5 point guard with dynamic shot-making ability, live-ball passing prowess and significant defensive versatility with his chiseled frame and 6-10 wingspan. Catch him on the wrong night and you'll probably wonder what all the fuss is about considering his propensity for live-ball turnovers (he sports a concerning 22% turnover percentage), his extreme struggles finishing inside the paint (41% 2-point shooting), his over-reliance on difficult floaters and pull-up jumpers, and the lack of awareness he shows defensively running into screens and getting lost off the ball. Take out Hood-Schifino's incredible three-game outburst from beyond the arc and he's shooting a more modest 12-for-43 (28%) from 3 while converting 69% of his free throws. For that reason, the next six weeks will be telling in figuring out where Hood-Schifino fits into the first-round equation. If he continues to grow and builds on his mostly strong Big Ten play thus far, he'll be firmly in lottery conversations. If he has more games like his 1-for-14 shooting against Maryland on Tuesday, he'll end up being a very polarizing prospect come draft time. -- Jonathan Givony","The Lakers exceeded expectations with a successful playoff run culminating in an appearance in the Western Conference finals. With LeBron James continuing to be one of the best players in the league and Anthony Davis having an encouraging season, there's plenty of room for optimism about bringing the band back and making another run in the West, which is as wide-open as it has been outside of the defending champions. That starts on draft night, armed with the highest pick they've had since selecting Lonzo Ball in 2017, which they'll need to use wisely considering the luxury tax crunch they are in and the limited means for improvement that exist in the new collective bargaining agreement.  Player fit Hood-Schifino has steadily climbed up draft boards all season. He's one of the most physically gifted prospects in the class at 6-5 .5 in shoes, 217 pounds with a 6-10 wingspan, enviable measurements considering he spent much of the season at point guard in a pick-and-roll heavy offensive scheme at Indiana. The flashes he shows as an off-the-dribble shot-maker and live-dribble passer are enticing, especially when paired with the toughness he displays defensively -- which was his calling card as a prospect prior to college. Finding more consistency with his decision-making, shooting and off-ball awareness defensively will help determine how big of a splash he makes early in his career. But there's little doubt that he has considerable upside to grow into long-term thanks to his tools and talent.-- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jaime Jaquez Jr",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UCLA","UCLA",NA,NA,NA,"March 20, 2023 Jaquez took care of business in leading UCLA to a third consecutive Sweet 16, doing all the little things that make him a winning player. He made a pair of 3-pointers, moved the ball intelligently, went to work creating his own shot in the high, mid or low post, and made big plays defensively -- all things we've become accustomed to seeing in his four years with the Bruins. Nothing he does is particularly aesthetically pleasing or looks certain to seamlessly translate to what his role will be in the NBA, but it's difficult not to appreciate the tremendous feel for the game, competitiveness and versatility Jaquez offers.-- Jonathan Givony March 14, 2023 The Pac-12 player of the year and All-American is one of the faces of college basketball and the key behind UCLA's season. His productivity, feel for the game, defensive cleverness, toughness and versatility are some of his biggest selling points as a prospect, even if his lack of shooting consistency (33% career from 3), average explosiveness and bully ball style make him somewhat of a polarizing prospect among NBA scouts. At 6-foot-6, he plays mostly at power forward but sees a considerable share of UCLA's offense run through him in the mid or low post; it's a different role than what he'll play in the NBA. The contributions Jacquez makes to winning is what put him on the map as an NBA prospect. The further UCLA goes into the tournament, the more chances he has of endearing himself to teams and showing what makes him tick.-- Jonathan Givony Dec. 27, 2022 Jaquez has been on NBA radars for what seems like forever, as a four-year starter who is on track to finish his UCLA career as a top-10 scorer in program history. After a slow start, Jaquez has been playing like the All-American he was billed as when electing to return for his senior season, carrying UCLA to an 11-2 start that puts it firmly in contention for a return to the NCAA Final Four, which Jaquez helped propel the Bruins to in 2021. Jaquez is playing a different role this season, tasked with significant offensive responsibility as UCLA's primary half-court creator. He sees his touches in various ways, alternating between the low post, midpost and the perimeter, where he plays a lot of pick-and-roll and is asked to create his own shot frequently in isolation. Playing exclusively off two feet with a wide array of jump-stops, pump-fakes, reverse pivot moves and bully-ball plays, Jaquez doesn't have the most aesthetically pleasing style. He relies heavily on his aggressiveness and physicality, bullying weaker opponents with polished footwork and creativity finishing around the basket. He's an excellent passer who can drive and dish and make intelligent skip passes, and he knows how to draw fouls, but he'll likely need to play a different style in the NBA than the one he does in college. Jaquez is shooting fewer 3-pointers this season than ever before and has converted just 23% of his attempts, a significant dropoff from the 39% he made as a sophomore. He still shows shot-making prowess with strong mechanics and a polished midrange game, converting 49% of his attempts on decent volume, as well as 77% of his free throws. NBA teams will likely want to see his 3-point volume and accuracy rise but considering his heavy on-ball role for one of the most efficient offenses in college basketball, it's not clear that will happen. On the other end of the floor, Jaquez remains one of college basketball's premier off-ball defenders, showing outstanding instincts and awareness rotating to help teammates, fighting over screens, busting up dribble handoffs, generating a significant amount of deflections and steals, and providing timely rim protection. Seeing most of his minutes at power forward, his below-average size and quickness renders him less effective as a one-on-one defender, especially when switched onto faster players. NBA teams will have some questions about his ability to transition into being more of a wing. Jaquez is likely to be a polarizing prospect come draft time, as some teams might view him as a jack of all trades, master of nothing who doesn't have the explosiveness, perimeter shooting or upside they covet. Others could be attracted to his feel for the game, his productivity and the many ways he contributes to winning on both ends of the floor. He's making a case for consideration as a first-round pick with his play this season, something that would only be amplified with a deep NCAA tournament run. -- Jonathan Givony","After ultimately losing out on Bradley Beal to the Suns, the Heat will presumably remain in the hunt for whichever star guard next becomes available. For now, they're left to pick at No. 18, where they can add a younger player to their core. Miami is facing a cap crunch with playoff stalwarts Gabe Vincent and Max Strus up for new contracts, and also stands to beef up its perimeter defense moving forward. The Heat tends to buck consensus and take who they want in the draft, making this pick a bit tricky to peg for rival teams entering the night. Player fit Having more than proven himself during a decorated UCLA career, Jaquez is the type of tough, intelligent and versatile player who should help his new team immediately. Jaquez doesn't have one elite skill, but he also doesn't have many glaring weaknesses. He is able to toggle between both forward spots, make open shots, and win extra possessions in the run of play as a rebounder and defender. He's one of the more NBA-ready players in the class and saw his stock rise for that reason. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Podziemski is averaging an outstanding 23.8 points, 10.2 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.5 steals while shooting 57% for 2 and 48% for 3 over that stretch, helping him win co-WCC player of the year honors. Unfortunately for him, and NBA scouts, Podziemski's NCAA tournament hopes were dashed when Santa Clara lost in double overtime in the WCC tournament quarterfinals, leaving the Broncos hoping for an NIT invite on Sunday. Podziemski is shooting 45% for 3 on the season, but is much more than that, seeing a significant amount of offense handling in pick and roll, in isolation, pushing in transition, or coming off screens. He is smart when operating off hesitation moves, splitting or rejecting ball screens, and passing on the move, but has seen his production drop off fairly dramatically against better competition this season, shooting just 43% inside the arc with nearly as many turnovers as assists against top-100 caliber competition. NBA teams have some concerns about Podziemski's physical tools, as he doesn't boast great size, length or frame and has had some tough moments defensively one-on-one against better competition. With that said, he clearly brings an intriguing combination of toughness and smarts which allowed him to lead the WCC in rebounding and post a strong 1.8 steals per game. -- Jonathan Givony","The Warriors followed up their NBA championship in 2022 by losing to the Lakers in the Western Conference semis, which opened up quite a few question marks about how much juice is left to be squeezed out of the aging core of Stephen Curry (35 years old), Klay Thompson (33) and Draymond Green (33). Changes coming to the collective bargaining agreement will make it very expensive and increasingly difficult to continue to add players to the roster, which makes this draft pick all the more important considering how little the team has gotten out of their last half-dozen picks the past three years. Player fit Initially only testing the waters, Podziemski had a highly successful pre-draft process that saw him raise his stock considerably at both the NBA combine and private workouts. Podziemski fits the mold of guard many NBA teams are actively seeking, capable of playing on or off the ball, showing dynamic shooting with his feet set or pulling up off the dribble, and having an excellent feel for the game creating for teammates intelligently or moving to open spots on the floor to help his team's ball movement. There are some concerns defensively revolving around his short wingspan (6-5 .5) and average footspeed, but Podziemski's competitiveness, toughness and rebounding prowess are traits several NBA teams mentioned as standing out in individual workouts. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Cam Whitmore",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Villanova","VILL",NA,NA,NA,"March 9, 2023 As documented last month, it has been an up-and-down season for Villanova (16-15) and Whitmore, the Wildcats' highly touted freshman. They'll need to win three more games in three days at the Big East tournament to avoid missing the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2012. Nevertheless, there's a lot to like about what Whitmore offers from a physical standpoint and the flashes he has shown as a shot-creator and shot-maker. Additionally, he doesn't turn 19 until July. After Whitmore played some of his best basketball over the past few games, NBA teams hope to see him progress as a passer, perimeter shooter and defender in what are likely to be the final games of his college career. Those are all areas he has been inconsistent with this season. How much urgency Whitmore has to offer under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden will be a point of interest, as his intensity level disappointed at times this season.-- Jonathan Givony Feb. 4, 2023 A broken thumb suffered in early October caused Whitmore to miss the first seven games of the season, one reason he has struggled to live up to his billing as the Big East preseason freshman of the year since returning from the two-month absence. Villanova has sputtered to a 4-7 start in conference play, with a 10-12 record that will likely result in only the team's second missed NCAA tournament appearance since 2004. Whitmore hasn't been able to find much consistency, especially on the defensive end, where the game simply moves too fast for him currently. He has been much further behind on this end of the floor than most anticipated considering his chiseled frame, strong mobility and explosiveness; sporting a surprisingly casual demeanor, very poor technique off the ball, and a distinct lack of intensity that causes him to be out of position constantly. Opposing teams have targeted him relentlessly off screens and in pick and roll and have found considerable success in the process. Offensively, Whitmore has shown excellent flashes of shot-making prowess, throwing in pull-up jumpers to punish unders, deep jab-step 3-pointers and some ability to hit difficult step-backs that hint at his impressive scoring instincts. He's shooting 37% from 3 and 71% at the line. As a shot creator, Whitmore has found mixed results, posting three times as many turnovers as assists and rarely getting to the free throw line with just 13 attempts in 11 Big East games thus far. He relies heavily on his frame to bully his way through opponents but has really struggled to handle weakside rotations and has shown no sign of a midrange or floater game when defenses load up on his drives, combined with limited craft around the rim. It hasn't helped how dysfunctional Villanova's offense has looked this season, with nothing resembling a point guard and few players who could be described as above-average passers, which means nothing has come easy for the 18-year-old in the half court. He was starting to string together some better performances before two ugly road games against Marquette and St. John's last week again revealed many of the same flaws. Not turning 19 until July, time is on Whitmore's side and there have been enough high-level flashes of talent to keep him firmly in the lottery conversation. Over the next month, scouts will want to see him show growth with his feel for the game on both ends of the floor, play significantly harder as the likely end of his college career approaches and hopefully be more productive against high-level competition, with several tough games on the calendar in the coming weeks. -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 No player improved his draft stock in the month of April more than Whitmore, who averaged 18 points, 5 rebounds and 3.3 assists in just 17 minutes per game across the Nike Hoop Summit, Jordan Brand Classic and McDonald's All American games while also shining in practice settings. Whitmore is a power wing at 6-7 with a strong upper and lower body who resembles the Cavs' Isaac Okoro, the No. 5 overall pick in 2020. Although not overly long (6-7 wingspan), Whitmore brings a no-nonsense approach to the floor. He competes on the defensive end, runs the court hard in transition, attacks the rim aggressively and even showcases the type of playmaking potential and handle you don't traditionally see from downhill wings with his frame and vertical pop. Even if his decision-making is still improving, Whitmore isn't short on vision, as he made a handful of impressive deliveries off the live dribble with either hand over the course of Hoop Summit week. He's also a comfortable ball handler with an impressive blend of power and shift, which pairs well with his underrated playmaking ability. Whitmore's clear swing skill is his shooting, as he's just a 22% 3-point shooter (46 attempts) and a 50% free throw shooter (58 attempts) according to our database. He's far from a nonshooter, but speeding up and fine-tuning his stroke could certainly move him into the top-10 conversation, especially when you consider that he has a relatively high floor as a 3-and-D wing with additional upside given the glimpses of shot creation he has shown. Whitmore is one of the most NBA-ready prospects the Wildcats have ever hauled in, and could be the type of one-and-done lottery pick to help usher in the Kyle Neptune era in Philly. -- ESPN","Houston has been exploring trade options involving this pick, with a host of young players already on the roster in addition to their draft pick at No. 4, creating an opportunity for a value play. If they keep it, the best fit might be a forward who can contribute defensively and make shots, considering there are plenty of ball handlers already on the roster. Player fit Whitmore's stock slipped in the weeks leading up to the draft, as teams expressed serious concerns over his medical. There's an opportunity for a major value pick here as a result, as he slides down the board here to the Rockets. It's not hard to see what makes Whitmore so highly regarded on first glance, standing 6-7 in shoes with a ripped 235-pound frame, explosive finishing prowess and a clean shooting stroke that suggest good things to come as a shot-maker long-term. Scoring comes easily for the 18-year-old, especially in the open floor and when he can get himself downhill powerfully, where he's an absolute highlight reel. Becoming a better ball handler, passer and decision-maker, and a more reliable shooter will be key for reaching his full potential, as well as finding ways to bring intensity and more consistency on both ends of the floor. -- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Noah Clowney",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alabama","ALA",NA,NA,NA,"March 14, 2023 Clowney propelled himself into one-and-done conversations by playing an integral role for arguably the best team in college basketball, despite being one of the youngest freshmen in the class. He fits a clear NBA mold as a mobile, long-armed, high-energy big man with legit floor-spacing ability and outstanding defensive versatility. He plays a mature style that bodes well for his long-term outlook as his thin frame continues to evolve over time. Clowney's productivity and perimeter shooting have been inconsistent, but he has played some of his best games against high-level competition, which bodes well for Alabama as it moves into the most important games of its season.-- Jonathan Givony Dec. 27, 2022 Playing for a non-sneaker-affiliated grassroots program in Team Dickerson and away from the bright lights at Dorman High School in South Carolina, it's easy to understand why Clowney slipped below the radar prior to enrolling at Alabama. Back-to-back SEC freshman of the week honors and an impressive 16-point, 11-rebound, two-block performance in a win at No. 1-ranked Houston changed things quickly, especially once NBA scouts learned Clowney is the age of a high school senior, turning 18 only last summer. At 6-10, with a thin but well-proportioned frame, a 7-2 wingspan and excellent mobility, Clowney has strong physical tools for a big man, even though he needs to add bulk to his lanky frame. Clowney isn't the most polished or consistent offensive player but shows nice versatility to build around long term. He steps into open 3-pointers confidently (10-for-36 in 11 games) with acceptable mechanics, attacks closeouts with his head up, is quick off his feet for above-the-rim finishes, shows ability to make basic reads and passes, and plays with the type of aggressiveness you like to see from a player his age. Defensively, he brings good energy crashing the glass and strong instincts and mobility rotating for blocks inside the paint and beyond the arc. He also shows the ability to anchor a drop defense much more effectively than most players with his level of experience, staying down on fakes patiently and being difficult to shoot over with his standing reach. His lack of strength is an issue at times guarding older players, and he's still figuring out the nuances of defending on the perimeter, struggling a bit in space because of his somewhat upright stance, but it's never due to a lack of effort. Clowney might not yet be done growing and could still have another notch he can get to athletically, which would help him find another degree of explosiveness and physicality to match his speed and quickness getting off his feet. His decision-making is a work in progress, and his struggles from the free throw line (56%) temper some of the enthusiasm around his hot-shooting start (primarily fueled by one 5-for-12 outlier game from beyond the arc against South Dakota State). Not considered a one-and-done candidate entering the season, Clowney could benefit from another year in college to improve his frame and continue to add polish on both ends of the floor, but he certainly checks some boxes NBA teams look for in a young big man. -- Jonathan Givony","The Nets were forced to pivot away from their big three of Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving and start a new era built around Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson and a host of future draft picks. Unfortunately for Brooklyn, the fact that many of their own picks were shipped out in the failed Harden trade means they don't have much choice but to try and stay competitive, which eliminates the possibility of a full-blown rebuild we've seen on other teams. Continuing to improve their backcourt -- especially if they can find a point guard of the future to complement Spencer Dinwiddie -- looks like a priority in the short term. Player fit Playing very much off the radar in South Carolina, Clowney wasn't considered a one-and-done type prospect entering Alabama. He quickly changed the narrative by emerging as the starting power forward of one of the best teams in college basketball and an anchor for a stout Alabama defense that helped deliver both an SEC regular season and conference tournament championship. At 6-10, with a 7-2 wingspan, excellent mobility, and a frame that should fill out considerably, he combines strong tools with the type of floor-spacing prowess and defensive versatility every team in the NBA covets. Clowney isn't a polished offensive player, and his lack of physical strength might be an issue projecting to the short term, but he's one of the youngest prospects in the draft, has coveted two-way versatility, and is on the type of trajectory that suggests significant room for improvement down the road.-- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Dariq Whitehead",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Duke","DUKE",NA,NA,NA,"March 14, 2023 Whitehead's season was marred early by injuries, and he hasn't been able to carve out as a big role as expected even recently when healthy, playing 16 minutes per game off the bench over the past six games. Despite shooting 40% for 3 and showing strong flashes defensively, Whitehead's struggles as a decision-maker, creator and finisher have made it difficult for him to gain traction and solidify his candidacy as a first-round prospect, as there are real questions about his lack of explosiveness and ability to generate efficient offense. NBA teams say they'd like to see a lot more from Whitehead against the high-level competition the NCAA tournament offers to help reconcile his lofty standing entering college with the underwhelming production we've seen thus far.-- Jonathan Givony Feb. 4, 2023 Averaging just 8.4 points while shooting 39.7% from 2-point range, the lowest rate of any prospect in our Top 100, it's safe to say that this has been an underwhelming season for Whitehead thus far. Part of that is because of injuries, as he suffered a stress fracture in his right foot in late August that caused him to miss 2.5 months of action before appearing to sprain an ankle last week, costing him two games and counting but has a chance to return on Saturday. Even beyond the injuries, Whitehead has struggled to be effective. He has been unable to generate high percentage opportunities for himself or others in the half-court or open floor, not being able to turn the corner against better defenders, settling for far too many floaters and midrange pull-ups, barely getting to the free throw line and showing poor decision-making, posting more turnovers than assists. His lack of explosiveness was noted in high school but has been much more problematic against higher-level competition, and his best moments offensively have come when he takes and makes difficult shots from the perimeter, something he's capable of doing (37% from 3) despite being an elevation shooter who at times releases the ball on the way down thanks to his strong shot-making prowess. Defensively, Whitehead has had far more success, using his solid frame, long arms and high intensity level to make an impact chasing opponents around screens, closing out on the perimeter and executing his team's game plan. NBA teams are struggling to get a handle on how to evaluate Whitehead as they don't see the same upside his lofty high school recruiting ranking indicates because of his just-average physical tools and lack of productivity. The fact that he's one of the youngest players in this draft, not turning 19 until August, and shows flashes of 3-and-D potential with some occasional playmaking chops does give him something to build on as he gets healthy and hopefully continues to progress as his freshman year evolves, but scouts say they want to see a lot more from him in the next month-plus. -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 Whitehead has one of the highest floors of any player in the freshman class -- a battle-tested four-year contributor at Montverde Academy who has been on the radar since he was 14. He has good size and length for a wing at 6-7 with a near 6-10 wingspan, and is a willing and capable defender who showed the ability to slow down guards and wings alike with his strong intensity level, physical style and excellent awareness off the ball. Offensively, Whitehead has made major strides with his jumper, showing the ability to hit shots in increasingly dynamic fashion, be it running off screens, pulling up in transition or playing off step-backs, although he's still very much on the streaky side, especially in terms of shot selection. Whitehead is also a good decision-maker as a passer who was well-coached and does a lot of things that contribute to winning. He's not the most explosive athlete around, having some limitations as a ball handler and shot creator and playing a somewhat inefficient style this season, especially when his tough shots weren't falling. Still, he's one of the youngest players in this class, not turning 18 until August, and is already as proven a player as you'll find in the high school ranks. -- Jonathan Givony Jan. 21, 2022 Whitehead is the youngest American player in this mock draft, not turning 18 until August, but made his Hoophall Classic debut as a 13-year-old in 2018. A transition scorer and versatile defender who has made major strides with his pull-up jumper, Whitehead is trying to make the jump from consummate glue guy to more of a featured option on a weaker Montverde Academy team this season, something that's been a work in progress. While he undeniably has an extremely high floor as the type of two-way prospect every NBA team covets, we're still learning more about his ceiling. -- Jonathan Givony Jan. 19, 2021 Identified when he was a 13-year-old playing up on a loaded Montverde roster prior to even enrolling in high school, Whitehead has added additional facets to his game every time we've watched him the past three years. Still only 16, Whitehead stood out once again as one of the most versatile players in attendance, helping Montverde to an undefeated record while doing a little bit of everything on both ends of the floor. Now sporting a solidly built 6-6, 190-pound frame to go along with impressive athletic ability, Whitehead was tasked with more shot-creation responsibilities than he had in the past. Able to probe with his dribble operating at different speeds, especially going to his left, Whitehead plays a mature and under control game, driving with his head up and looking for teammates while also capable of absorbing contact in the lane himself. His jumper, while not broken, remains a work in progress, as he shoots a set-shot pull-up from behind the arc and is prone to putting significant side-spin on spot-up jumpers, leading to inconsistent results. Active and engaged defensively, Whitehead fights over screens with his quick feet, contains dribble penetration using his strong frame, contests jumpers with his length and often finishes the play by cleaning the glass. Already on an excellent trajectory, it will be interesting to see how Whitehead's jumper and overall scoring ability evolve next season when he steps into an even bigger role for Montverde as a senior. He seems well on his way to establishing himself as one of the best prospects in his class considering the steady progress he's making. -- Jonathan Givony Oct. 9, 2018 The youngest player at the USA Basketball junior team minicamp, Whitehead was also the best all-around athlete. He is dynamic in transition, can make a spot 3 despite a slow release and plays with considerable swagger for his age. His skill set could use polish, but he holds tremendous upside. -- ESPN","After drafting Noah Clowney with the No. 21 pick, the Nets selected Duke's Dariq Whitehead with their second first-round pick. Player fit After entering the season projected in the lottery, Whitehead's one-and-done year at Duke didn't go according to plan, as he dealt with a foot injury that delayed his start to the season and never quite returned to his high school form. What he did do well was shoot the 3-ball (42% on the season), which, ironically was one of the previous concerns. The real Whitehead is probably somewhere in between the lofty expectations and the current reality. If he can stay healthy, he figures to be a useful utility wing who can supply some scoring and defense on the wing. He's only 18 years old which suggests he has plenty of time to figure it out, making him a nice pick this far down in the draft.-- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Murray doesn't quite have one consistent means of scoring but is solid across the board, being an acceptable, albeit streaky, perimeter shooter with a good feel for the game who can push off the defensive glass, score in the post and move off the ball resourcefully. Murray's aggressiveness and toughness comes and goes some, and he is much older than most first-round prospects, set to 23 in August, so finding a way to finish strong and staying productive after coming up short in last year's NCAA tournament will be beneficial.-- Jonathan Givony ","With their second first-round pick, the Trail Blazers gave us some more insight into their thought process regarding the balancing act they are trying to pull off between staying competitive in the midst of Damian Lillard's prime, while trying to stockpile talent for when his era in Portland inevitably comes to an end.  Player fit Murray isn't quite the same caliber of prospect as his twin brother Keegan, who was selected fourth by the Kings in 2022, but he does reliably do some valuable things: He can make open shots from range, he can operate effectively without the ball, and he rebounds and defends at a solid level standing 6-9.

He participated in five individual workouts with NBA teams before the combine and now has a busy schedule the next four weeks that will see him visit most of the teams picking in the first round. Prosper fits a prototype many NBA teams are actively seeking with his ability to play either forward spot as his perimeter shooting (34% from 3 last season) continues to evolve. -- Jonathan Givony","Sacramento traded No. 24 to Dallas, who used a traded player exception to also acquire Richaun Holmes from Sacramento and select Prosper. This is a salary cap-focused decision by the Kings. Player fit Prosper was one of the biggest winners of the pre-draft process, entering the combine as a projected second-rounder and leaving it with real first-round interest. Good showings on the workout circuit culminated in a green room invite and his selection here, much higher than anyone would have expected during the college season. At a strong 6-8 with a 7-1 wingspan, Prosper will fit in the NBA physically right away, but may also take some time to develop into a highly-active, two-way wing who can help space the floor.

Sasser's shot-making ability was on full display, hitting a difficult transition pull-up 3, two snatchback 3s out of isolation to punish the switching big man, and then icing the game with a tough corner 3 off movement. Sasser looked somewhat hobbled pushing in the open court and especially staying in front of the lightning-quick Wendell Green, but that was to be expected considering his injury. How healthy he's able to get in the coming days as Houston takes on Miami and then the winner of Xavier/Texas should they advance will be huge for its Final Four chances, as a strong performance will surely help his cause for first-round pick consideration on draft night. -- Jonathan Givony March 14, 2023 Sasser is one of the most explosive scorers in college basketball and the go-to guy of a Houston team that many consider to be favorites to cut down the nets on April 3 at NRG Stadium, located 5.6 miles away from Houston's campus. Sasser is an aggressive, shot-making combo guard who defends with toughness and can make basic reads out of pick-and-rolls. He is difficult to contain in the open floor, is an outstanding spot-up shooter and brings the type of two-way competitiveness NBA teams covet, being well-schooled under Kelvin Sampson. Sasser didn't quite have the breakout first-team All-American season some expected, struggling at times with decision-making and efficiency inside the arc, especially against better teams. Big games on the biggest platforms of his college career will go a long way in endearing him to NBA scouts, as he isn't blessed with the same type of explosiveness or upside as some of his peers in this class.-- Jonathan Givony ","The Celtics drafted Sasser and immediately dealt him to the Pistons in a deal that saw them move back to No. 31 and acquire future second-round picks. Detroit was quite high on Sasser and hoping he'd fall to No. 31, and moved up to ensure another team didn't grab him first. Player fit Sasser is one of the more NBA-ready guards in the draft, with a strong college resume and well-rounded game. He's a good shooter and defender in the backcourt who can toggle on and off the ball, giving him a nice pathway to immediate value.

Sheppard appears to have helped himself in the pre-draft process, starting at the NBA combine where he showed his gaudy production in the Missouri Valley translated against better competition, and then continuing in private workouts, where he shot the ball extremely well after making 41% of his 3-pointers this past season. -- Jonathan Givony ","The Pacers entered draft night with four picks in the top 32, and were widely expected to move around in search of value rather than use all of them.

"ESPN","Nick Smith Jr",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arkansas","ARK",NA,NA,NA,"March 27, 2023 An uneven season came to a disappointing end for Smith and Arkansas in the Sweet 16 with a blowout loss to UConn. Smith started the game hot but cooled, finishing his NCAA tournament shooting 6-for-23 in three games with two rebounds and an assist. Smith never looked like himself relative to what we saw at the high school level and in his spectacular run to the Nike EYBL championship game (alongside Miller) in the summer 2021, which propelled him into consideration as the No. 1 prospect in his recruiting class. Multiple executives told ESPN they consider Smith the best NBA prospect in his class after the McDonald's and Jordan Brand Classic practices, scrimmages and JBC game, where he scored 24 points in 21 minutes. NBA teams will want to learn more about the knee injuries Smith suffered in early November, which caused him to play just five games through mid-February. He's never been the most explosive driver or powerful finisher, even before his injuries, but shooting under 40% inside the arc was a surprising outcome this season after converting nearly 60% of his 2-pointers and living at the free throw line in previous settings. Smith has always been at his best with the ball in his hands. His ability to change speeds, polished footwork, live-dribble passing, creative finishing and off-the-dribble shot-making shine through. Playing on a team with several teammates who are similarly ball-dominant in Black, Devo Davis and Ricky Council and not having the chance to grow through the season with his decision-making likely played a role in Smith's struggles. He was usually relegated to standing in the corner and looked sped up when he was called upon to create in Arkansas' dysfunctional and poorly spaced offense, often settling for difficult floaters and pull-ups from outside the paint. Still only 18 years old, Smith has time to work on his frame and better channel his frenetic energy as he's nearly 18 months younger than his former teammate Miller. Smith has looked frustrated with his struggles both on and off the floor in recent weeks, telling reporters ""people don't know I've been through so much stuff this year,"" after Arkansas advanced in the Sweet 16, while having some emotional outbursts on the bench. Most players in Smith's position would not have even been playing, as it was widely assumed among NBA teams that he would likely shut down his season and fully heal his injury once he was removed from the lineup for a second time. His decision to return might cost him on draft night, but it will be appreciated by some teams because of what it says about his character. Getting back to 100% for private team workouts should help Smith show a different side of his game.-- Jonathan Givony  March 14, 2023 After the freshman guard missed 19 games with knee injuries, NBA teams say they still have a lot to learn about Smith, who is just starting to round into the form that made him the No. 1 prospect in college basketball entering the season. Smith had the unenviable task of being thrown straight into SEC competition and building chemistry with teammates on the fly, something that has looked like a work in progress at times. The fact that he is 18 years old and weighs only 185 pounds hasn't made things any easier. Smith fits a clear and coveted NBA mold as a shot-creating guard who can shoot off the bounce, pass off a live dribble, finish with creativity around the rim and bring strong competitiveness defensively. He isn't afraid of the moment and plays with an edge on both ends of the floor. And he impressed NBA scouts by playing at all right now, as most projected top-10 picks in his position would have elected to shut down their season amid injury concerns. Smith's lack of strength and high-end explosiveness has made it difficult for him to generate efficient offense at times this season. He is shooting 44% inside the arc and 35% beyond it and hasn't yet been able to show what truly makes him unique as a potential big point guard with his strong vision and unselfishness that haven't fully been realized yet in college. Arkansas doesn't have an easy road to the second weekend of the NCAA tournament, as a No. 8 seed playing against No. 9 Illinois and potentially No. 1 Kansas should the Razorbacks advance, meaning they'll need Smith at his best.-- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 The Arkansas-bound 18-year-old guard was one of the biggest winners of the high school All-Star circuit and is the clear front-runner to be the first NCAA player to hear his name called from the 2022 high school class. While he did have some ups and downs during Hoop Summit week, Smith put on an absolute show in Chicago during a Jordan Brand Classic scrimmage in one of the more impressive performances I've seen live from a prospect in that type of setting. Smith showed the whole bag with NBA execs in attendance, making 3s off the bounce, changing speed and direction suddenly with incredible footwork, finishing creatively in traffic, spraying the ball out to open teammates, threading the needle in the open court and bringing energy on the defensive end of the floor. We've seen shifty shot-creating guards like Smith before, but it's a rarity when they also share the defensive motor and intensity that he brings to the court. He routinely shows real leadership qualities as well, getting on teammates for lack of effort or taking ownership of his own mistakes. For as talented as he is, Smith still has room to grow as a decision-maker, ball handler versus aggressive pressure, and shooter, as he's more streaky than knockdown at this stage. While still refining a few aspects of his game, the Little Rock-born Smith has legitimate star power and has an excellent situation to showcase his talent on an Arkansas team that could compete for a national championship. With the NBA valuing shot-creating guards who can defend more than ever, Smith should be highly sought after if he has the type of freshman season I think he's capable of in Fayetteville. -- ESPN Jan. 21, 2022 The 17-year-old offers a tantalizing combination of size, length, fluidity, shot-making, playmaking and competitiveness defensively, giving him an ideal package for a modern NBA guard prospect. A late bloomer who didn't solidify himself in the five-star conversation until the Nike EYBL last summer, he has plenty of work to do in the strength department, contributing to his lack of high-end explosiveness/power operating in the lane, and can be a little casual with his shot selection and decision-making. Playing off the ball quite a bit in the past, Smith is only now starting to mold himself into a lead guard, the evolution of which will play a major role in how he's viewed as an NBA prospect, as well as how he progresses physically. He already looks like one of the most skilled guards in the class at using and rejecting ball screens with his outstanding ballhandling, vision and creativity passing off a live dribble and operating off hesitation moves, something that's only amplified by his impressive range on pull-up jumpers. -- Jonathan Givony ","The Hornets entered the night one of the most well-stocked teams in the NBA in terms of draft picks, possessing the No. 2 and No. 27 selections in addition to three favorable second-rounders. The worst-ranked offensive team in the league last year, with an extreme lack of shooting throughout the roster, the front office has plenty of work ahead as the franchise ushers in a new ownership group that will surely want to put their imprint on the way the team conducts its business as soon as the sale officially closes. Player fit Smith started the season a projected top-five pick, but ended up seeing his stock drop as injuries limited him to just 17 games, many of which he looked like a shell of himself compared with what we saw in high school. Still, there's a lot to like about the combination of scoring instincts, shot-creation prowess, shot-making ability, passing and competitiveness, which portends good things to come considering he just turned 19. His slender frame, as well as his struggles as a finisher around the basket and point-of-attack defender might make it difficult for him to be an overly efficient option on both ends of the floor early in his career, but it's hard not to be enamored with his long-term upside considering what he's shown in previous settings prior to enrolling at Arkansas..-- Jonathan Givony",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Brice Sensabaugh",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ohio State","OSU",NA,NA,NA,"March 9, 2023 At 5-15 in Big Ten play, Ohio State is in the midst of its worst season in 25 years. That's something NBA scouts will certainly weigh when evaluating the gaudy scoring production of super freshman Sensabaugh, who has hit a wall over the past 10 games from an efficiency standpoint, shooting 30% for 3 and 50% inside the arc. Even with Sensabaugh's recent struggles, he's still the second-most-prolific per-minute scorer in college basketball among projected draft picks, trailing only runaway National Player of the Year favorite Zach Edey. Sensabaugh has a clear case to be considered the best perimeter shooter in this draft in terms of volume and accuracy (42% 3P%) and is far from being just a shooter, also showing quite a bit of potential in the pick-and-roll, when creating one-on-one and as a post-scorer; he's capable of putting the ball in the basket from anywhere on the floor. The biggest questions revolve around his defense, where he's stuck between positions as a 6-6 power forward with average length, a husky frame and inconsistent intensity and awareness that causes him to be frequently targeted and scored on by opponents. As the No. 13 seed in the loaded Big Ten tournament, just advancing another day or two would be considered a major success for the Buckeyes, something Sensabaugh will play a large role in on both ends of the floor. How much progress Sensabaugh can make with his body during the pre-draft process (assuming he elects to enter the draft) will be even more crucial, as NBA teams want to see him get in much better shape to take him as seriously as his outstanding scoring production suggests they should. -- Jonathan Givony Dec. 27, 2022 At 29 points per 40 minutes, Sensabaugh isn't just the best per-minute scorer in this freshman class, he's one of the most dangerous offensive players in college basketball. After initially limiting his playing time because of defensive concerns, Ohio State inserted him into its starting lineup earlier this month. He had his best performance of the season at the CBS Sports Classic at Madison Square Garden, where NBA executives saw him explode for 22 points, eight rebounds and three assists against North Carolina, including the potential game-winning shot over one of the best defenders in the country in 23-year-old Leaky Black. Sensabaugh doesn't look like a potential one-and-done prospect at first glance as he's undersized for the power forward position he often plays at 6-6 with wide hips, thick legs and average length. He clearly needs to continue to improve his conditioning, something he has started to address since leading the Nike EYBL in per-minute scoring at 38.5 points per 40 minutes in summer 2021. But he's a better athlete than he gets credit for, possessing impressive body control and some underrated explosiveness as a finisher around the basket. Sensabaugh is an elite perimeter shooter, converting 49% of his 3-point attempts this season. He's dynamic with his shot-making ability, showing the ability to hit pull-up jumpers, relocate off shot fakes for difficult side-step attempts, and he has a quick release and polished footwork getting into spot-up 3-pointers. He's also capable of creating offense for himself in the post, elevating in midrange spots or attacking the rim aggressively with his strong frame and solid ballhandling ability. After looking somewhat like a black hole early in the season, Sensabaugh has shown some passing chops in small doses, posting 10 assists in his past two games after generating just two assists in the first month of the season. Defensively is where the biggest questions remain, as Sensabaugh often looks lost off the ball, rarely gets in a defensive stance, shows bad closeout technique and gets scored on frequently in the post. His lack of size, length and quickness is an issue, but so is his lack of intensity. He generates very few steals, blocks or rebounds to complement his incredible scoring prowess. He has struggled with foul trouble in some of the toughest games he has played in thus far, something that could be a bigger issue now that he's receiving starting-caliber minutes going into Big Ten play. -- Jonathan Givony","This pick felt the most likely of the Jazz's three first-rounders to move going into draft night, with Utah in position to add quality players at 9 and 16. It appears they are keeping it, however. Player fit Sensabaugh saw his stock slip a bit over the course of the pre-draft process due in part to concerns around his health and conditioning -- a knee issue ended his season at Ohio State early that limited what he could do in workouts, falling in line with a history of knee injuries dating back to high school. He's one of the more gifted scorers in the draft, with a smooth jumper and great instincts creating his shot, but isn't much of a defender at this point. If Sensabaugh can get his body right, this could be a strong value for the Jazz. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Brown doesn't look like a high-level NBA prospect at first glance, being undersized and needing to improve his frame. His skill level very much suits the modern NBA, though, as a 45% 3-point shooter who initiates quite a bit of offense for Missouri pushing off the defensive glass and operating in the mid and high post thanks to his strong feel for the game. He is a good ball handler, deft passer and dynamic shot-maker in addition to being a real mismatch with his strength, skill and versatility, having guard skills despite playing mostly at center with his powerful frame. Brown's defense will be heavily scrutinized by NBA teams, as he doesn't have great length for a 5, doesn't cover ground very well on an island to guard better 4s and is just an average rebounder. NBA teams will want to get a better feel for Brown during the pre-draft process, and continuing to build momentum in the NCAA tournament certainly wouldn't hurt his draft stock.-- Jonathan Givony ","This pick was nearly traded from the Clippers to the Wizards on Wednesday before a three-team deal involving the Clippers, Wizards and Celtics fell apart. (That deal took place with Memphis as the third team, instead of LA). So the Clippers entered the night sitting here at 30 after all, thought to be eyeing an array of wing players that could fall to the back of the first round. Player fit Brown enjoyed a strong year at Missouri, making strides as a shooter and showcasing his toughness and versatility over the course of a winning season for his team. He piqued NBA interest as a result, with teams always hunting for glue guys who can make shots, pass, and contribute on the glass. There are some concerns about Brown's heavier body type and defensive contributions -- he's active but a bit slow-footed.

"ESPN","James Nnaji",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Nigeria","Nigeria",NA,NA,NA,"Feb. 4, 2023 Playing for Barcelona, currently in first place in the Spanish ACB and third in the EuroLeague, minutes haven't been easy to come by for 18-year-old Nnaji in his team's stacked frontcourt rotation. Two recent starting nods in domestic league play have allowed NBA scouts to get a deeper look at the chiseled 6-11 Nigerian with a 7-4 wingspan, and he responded by posting 32 points and eight rebounds in 43 minutes of action on near-perfect 13-for-14 shooting, leaving one to wonder how productive he would be in a situation with more consistent playing time. Nnaji's virtues are readily obvious at first glance, as he's one of the most physically gifted prospects in this draft class, blessed with incredible quickness getting off his feet for dunks and blocks, and outstanding mobility running the floor and covering ground defensively. He draws quite a few fouls with his enviable combination of speed, power and explosiveness, putting pressure on opposing defenses every time he rolls to the basket and offering a significant vertical spacing target with his improving hands and huge catch radius. Nnaji is also making subtle improvement as the season continues with his passing and ability to take slower defenders off the dribble in a straight line with huge strides, things that are very much a work in progress due to his average skill level but are still encouraging to see considering his lack of experience. Nnaji only started playing basketball in July 2016 and moved to Ratgeber Basketball Academy in Hungary off a Facebook post he made following the Giants of Africa camp in 2018. He spent two years in Hungary before moving to Barcelona in August 2020, progressing through the ranks of their junior teams and the Spanish fifth division to carve out the role he has now. Nnaji's processing speed and awareness on both ends of the floor are still a work in progress, but the fact that he can make the impact he does on both ends of the floor mostly off his tools gives him plenty of upside to grow into as the game slows down for him. With his minutes likely to be inconsistent for the remainder of the season and Barcelona's schedule through the month of June likely preventing him from conducting private workouts with NBA teams, getting a firm handle on Nnaji's draft stock won't be easy, but he's done well to solidify his candidacy as a first-round prospect with the opportunities he's received thus far. -- Jonathan Givony Nov. 7, 2022 Competing at a higher level than any prospect in this draft class, minutes haven't always been easy to come by for Nnaji in the EuroLeague and Spanish ACB with Barcelona, one of the best teams in European basketball. After not playing in many of its first games, the past five contests have seen a steady uptick in opportunities for Nnaji (averaging 13 minutes), which has coincided with small but steady improvement that has to be considered promising for NBA scouts monitoring his progress as he enters his first year of draft eligibility. Nnaji is one of the most physically gifted players in this class, blessed with a chiseled frame even by NBA standards and quickness covering ground and getting off his feet for offensive rebounds, dunks and blocks. While those areas constitute the bulk of his intrigue and are highly in demand for a role-playing center tasked with anchoring a defense and finishing plays after being spoon-fed around the basket, he has shown some minor flashes to suggest there's more there. Nnaji had several strong drives in a EuroLeague game against Milan last week that you wouldn't expect to see from a raw big man in his mold, taking former NBA player Brandon Davies off the dribble from beyond the 3-point line and finishing with an impressive slow-down move after getting to the rim off a single dribble thanks to his long, powerful strides. He also has utilized shot fakes, flip shots and off-hand hooks that weren't in his repertoire at this point last season. And he has made some simple passes out of the post, which is encouraging to see considering how limited he was previously. Nnaji still crushes the rim every time he catches the ball in the vicinity of the basket with his incredible power elevating off two feet. And he is a major presence setting screens and rolling to the rim out of the pick-and-roll, even if he isn't quite as reliable catching lobs considering his projected role due to his just decent hands and awareness tracking balls in the air. He still has a long way to go before he can be considered a real offensive player -- as evidenced by his career 44% free throw rate, which hasn't improved this season. He is very mistake-prone at times, being called for moving screens, blatant push-offs and other unforced errors. And it's generally an adventure anytime he needs to make a decision with the ball, so we'll have to see how his recent uptick in productivity translates for the rest of the season. Where Nnaji could be special is on the defensive end; he makes a huge impact with his combination of length, strength and mobility, especially switching onto guards on the perimeter, sliding his feet and being extremely difficult to shoot over. He turns his hips exceptionally well to cover ground, get back into plays and protect the rim, averaging an excellent 3.3 blocks per 40 minutes in the EuroLeague and ACB, which makes him one of the best players in both leagues in that category so far this season. He has room to grow here too, especially with his reaction time, technique and processing speed, which at times put him behind on plays both in getting schooled one-on-one by older and wilier players and being late and out of position more than you'd like to see off the ball. He is not a good defensive rebounder and is a little more mistake-prone than you'd like, but the intensity he plays with, the exceptional physical ability he possesses and the way he covers ground and gets off his feet for blocks already makes him a significant deterrent at this level of competition, which is extremely impressive considering his lack of experience. Overall, Nnaji seems to be making slow but steady progress, and it's no surprise he is seeing an uptick in minutes considering the way he impacts the game on both ends of the floor. There are only a handful of players in this draft who would have a chance to see playing time for Barcelona coach Sarunas Jasikevicius and hold their own in the highly tactical EuroLeague and ACB, and it's certainly possible that the more unscripted and free-flowing NBA game could actually suit Nnaji much better. -- Jonathan Givony Oct. 4, 2022 Nnaji has seen just six total minutes of action for Barcelona in their first four cup and league games, as he's currently buried on their depth chart behind some of the best big men in Europe in Jan Vesely, Mike Tobey, Sertac Sanli and Oscar da Silva. Should the situation continue, a loan to a smaller ACB team might be the ideal situation for Nnaji to get playing time and show why he's deemed to have lottery-level upside with his outstanding physical tools, shot-blocking and finishing ability, but it's not clear how quickly Barcelona would be willing to let him go considering the energy and physicality he brings to practice daily. -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 Nnaji is arguably the most NBA-ready prospect in this class from a physical perspective, standing 6-10, 245 pounds with a huge 7-7 wingspan and the type of frame that would make even a powerful big like Isaiah Stewart proud. He also has similar measurements to a young Bismack Biyombo. After a rapid ascension from Nigeria to Hungary and now to Barcelona, Nnaji was a surprise success for the Spanish powerhouse this season, logging over 150 Euroleague and Spanish ACB minutes in his debut season under hard-nosed head coach and former NBA guard ar&#363;nas Jasikevi&#269;ius. Nnaji is still improving his offensive decision-making, perimeter defense and ability to play without fouling, but he's an elite offensive rebounder, an excellent rim-protector (4 blocks per 40 minutes in ACB play) and the type of highly regarded worker who should continue to improve. While his ceiling might be limited somewhat by his shortcomings as a half-court scorer or offensive hub, he has a clear role as an offensive-rebounding, shot-blocking center who has the agility to eventually add value defending the perimeter, as we've seen from Stewart with the Pistons. -- ESPN Jan. 21, 2022 The best international big in this class (after Wembanyama) is Barcelona's James Nnaji, a Nigerian-born center who wasn't considered an NBA prospect less than two years ago playing in Hungary yet is now earning minutes for a club that rarely hands them out to young prospects. At 6-10, 245 pounds with a reported 7-7 wingspan, huge hands and impressive mobility, Nnaji sports one of the most impressive physical profiles you'll see from any big-man prospect, with dimensions comparable to Bismack Biyombo. He's already putting his tools to good use, recently scoring 10 points, grabbing 5 rebounds and swatting 5 shots in 19 minutes in his ACB debut. We saw him live against Efes in Euroleague action, where he more than held his own in a limited role for the first place Spanish powerhouse. Nnaji is a high-energy rebounder with the motor and physicality of Isaiah Stewart yet far more potential as a rim protector and pick-and-roll defender. -- ESPN","After initially moving up to No. 25 from No. 35 in the Kristaps Porzingis deal, Boston grabbed this pick from Detroit in trading back off of No. 25 for future second-round picks. Then, they traded the pick again, moving back with Charlotte to acquire Nos. 34 and 39.  Player fit Nnaji has an NBA-ready frame that might allow him to excel as a rim-running center in the modern game. He's not particularly skilled, but will come over from Barcelona with high-level experience in Europe and will have a physical advantage over some opponents immediately. He's still a bit of a project, but it won't be a surprise if he becomes a productive rebounder, finisher and shot-blocker moving forward. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Miller is using the pre-draft process to learn what he needs to work on to become the high-level player his sky-high potential suggests, and he walked out of Chicago with a long list of things he'll have to improve on long-term. None of this should be a surprise considering Miller was a 6-5, non-shooting guard just a few years ago, before hitting a late growth spurt and blossoming into a five-star-caliber prospect as a high school senior. Unlikely to secure the first-round assurances he's seeking, Miller will now likely be picking between attending college at Arizona and spending a year in the G League Ignite program. -- Jonathan Givony Apr. 21, 2022 Miller, who just finished a postgraduate year at Fort Erie International Academy in Canada, is still debating his next move -- the options include enrolling in college (Kentucky or Arizona), or signing with G League Ignite. He's also strongly considering entering his name in the 2022 NBA draft to see where he stands with teams and whether he can land assurances he'll hear his name called in the first round. Two quick fouls in the first two minutes limited Miller to just 18 minutes of action at the Hoop Summit, in which he was still able to score 11 points and grab five rebounds. Miller had a strong week of practice, looking like the best prospect on the World Team every time he stepped on the floor, especially considering he measured 6-11 in shoes with a 7-2 wingspan and 9-foot standing reach, which could even allow him to see some minutes as a small-ball center down the road as his frame fills out. Growing 6 inches over the past three years, Miller has clear guard skills, averaging over 30 points per game this season while showing tantalizing shot-making ability from all over the floor. He puts non-stop pressure on opposing defenses with his herky-jerky style, sniffing out plenty of baskets pushing or leaking out in the open court, off strong cuts and via the offensive glass. Miller's lack of strength and experience in high-level settings shows at times, as his shot selection can be questionable and his unorthodox shooting mechanics lead to varying results. It's clear that Miller is an NBA talent, as 18-year-olds with his size, length, scoring instincts and potential defensive versatility don't grow on trees, but it seems like a year in college or at the pro level could certainly help ease the significant transition he's about to undergo in coming from the Ontario Scholastic Basketball Association, which he was able to dominate without much resistance. -- Jonathan Givony","The Timberwolves acquired this pick from the Spurs on draft night for future second-rounders, giving them two picks in this year's second round. Player fit Miller took an estimable step forward in the G League last season, turning himself into a highly productive box score player and starting to harness his considerable physical gifts. It turned out teams weren't entirely sold on his profile, as reflected by his fall here. But Miller still offers a lot of tools to develop, with great length and some inside-out versatility at forward. He needs to refine his shooting and decision-making, and it may take him some time to see the floor in the NBA, but there just aren't that many athletes with his type of size, movement and basic skill set, which makes him a nice swing later in the draft. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Tasked with defending point guards through power forwards, while shouldering significant playmaking responsibilities, Jones' versatility and feel for the game are well-suited for the NBA, especially now that he has become a 38% 3-point shooter. His average explosiveness and at times shaky free throw shooting (64%) are two questions NBA teams have, and he is generally the type of prospect whose resume is built more around productivity and winning than incredible upside, meaning taking his team on a deep tournament run could be highly beneficial to cement his candidacy.-- Jonathan Givony Dec. 1, 2022 Xavier's Colby Jones had a breakout performance at the PK85 tournament, averaging 18 points, six rebounds and five assists while shooting 9-for-10 from beyond the arc in three games. Entering the season a career 30% 3-point shooter, Jones had some questions to answer in that department, especially since he doesn't pop from a physical standpoint with his average size, length, frame and explosiveness. Jones started off the season cold, not making a single 3-pointer in his first three games, but was scorching in Portland, which is a significant development considering how many NBA decision-makers were in attendance. Jones' passing ability and all-around feel for the game are what really make him interesting as a prospect, as well as the toughness he displays defensively. If he can continue to show that his outside shooting is real, he'll have a chance to enter the conversation as a first-round prospect with the other intangibles he brings to the table.-- Jonathan Givony ","The Sacramento Kings traded up with the Boston Celtics for the No. 34 pick in Thursday's draft for the No. 38 pick and a future second-round pick.Player fitJones checks the right boxes as a complementary perimeter player, as an unselfish, big guard who makes good decisions and open shots, and can make plays for teammates.

"ESPN","Julian Phillips",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tennessee","TENN",NA,NA,NA,"March 27, 2023 Phillips went scoreless in Tennessee's Sweet 16 exit at the hands of Florida Atlantic. Phillips lost his starting spot because of an ankle injury in mid-February and ended up playing just 46 minutes in the NCAA tournament over three games, scoring five points on 2-for-8 shooting. Phillips didn't have a very productive freshman season, struggling in a minor role to score with efficiency, shooting 47% inside the arc and 24% outside it. He doesn't have a consistent means of scoring, struggles to make open jumpers, lacks ballhandling ability and sees his best production via running in the open floor, crashing the offensive glass and cuts. But Phillips' positional size, length and frame give him some long-term upside, which could be intriguing enough for a second-round flier. He looks the part of a big-time small forward prospect and sometimes plays like it, too, bringing good energy crashing the offensive glass and showing some multi-positional defensive versatility with his intensity and physical tools. Workouts will play a key role in deciding how high in the second round Phillips could be picked, but there's a compelling case for him to return for another year in college.-- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 One of the only uncommitted one-and-done prospects in the country, Phillips is long and fluid at 6-7 with measurements similar to wings ranging from Jaden McDaniels to Terrance Ferguson to a young Herbert Jones. Although lean and wiry at this stage, the 18-year-old Phillips has the type of positional length and on-the-move shooting potential NBA teams generally look for in a teenage wing prospect. A Columbia, South Carolina, native, Phillips, who originally committed to LSU, led a strong Link Academy squad in scoring during three Geico High School Nationals games at 15.7 points in 25.7 minutes before falling to Whitehead, Lively and Montverde in the Finals. We couldn't get quite as extensive of a look at Phillips as other elite prospects since he didn't compete in the Nike Hoop Summit or Jordan Brand Classic, but from watching him at various high school events and studying his film, it's easy to see him generating lottery buzz depending on where he ultimately decides to spend his draft-eligible year. On top of his quickness, length and leaping ability, Phillips' shooting stroke is his most projectable NBA skill. He's comfortable rising into catch-and-shoot jumpers off pin-downs and staggers, while also elevating in midrange spots with sharp footwork. With that said, he's not all that physical of a finisher at this stage and is still searching for a more consistent defensive motor, despite having the tools to defend multiple perimeter spots and make plays off the ball. Overall, Phillips is one of the more intriguing non-lottery prospects in this class as he possesses several of the ingredients teams look for in an NBA wing. -- ESPN","The Wizards acquired this pick and Tyus Jones as the primary return in Wednesday's three-team deal that sent Kristaps Porzingis to Boston and Marcus Smart to Memphis. They then reportedly traded it to the Bulls, who entered the draft without any picks in hand. Player fit Phillips' freshman year at Tennessee was a bit underwhelming, but he does offer some things to like from a developmental perspective at 6-8 with a 6-11 1/2 wingspan and some capacity to shoot, finish plays and defend. Physically, he fits the prototype for wing forwards, but his actual game has a ways to go, and he doesn't project as much of an offensive option right now.

He had 31 assists, 28 rebounds and a barrage of winning plays in key moments. Jackson's ability to ignite the break pushing in the open court and spray passes everywhere has factored into UConn's postseason success, as he regularly goes into the paint with outstanding speed to find shooters on the wing driving and kickout. He's a major connector in the half court with touch passes, lobs, dribble handoffs and timely cuts off the ball, especially when Gonzaga didn't guard him. Jackson's lack of perimeter shooting (28% from 3, 65% free throws), average ballhandling in the half court, and overall struggles as a scorer haven't been as much of an issue the past two weekends as they were at points in the regular season, where his team often looked like they were playing 5-on-4 with the way opponents ignored him off the ball. Players in this mold can be difficult to hide in the NBA, but UConn has done everything it can to accentuate Jackson's strengths the past few weeks, giving him a stronger case as a first-round pick.

Lewis looked like he elected to enter the NBA draft in January and simply forgot to tell anyone, as he seemingly just went through the motions for much of conference play, shooting an alarming 47% from 2-point range and 26% from 3 with more turnovers than assists while playing even less defense than usual, even by his porous standards. Lewis will now need to answer difficult questions to convince teams in workouts and interviews that he's a better competitor than what he displayed, and that his situation and coaching staff had as much to do with his underachieving play. Despite the red flags, there will be a long line of NBA teams looking to learn more about Lewis during the pre-draft process. Everyone is looking for fluid, long-armed 6-7 wings with shot creation, shot-making versatility and upside, especially late bloomers like him. -- Jonathan Givony Dec. 27, 2022 Lewis took a circuitous route to Pepperdine, enrolling at four different high schools and then making a pit stop at the failed Chameleon BX program, a training program intended to prepare prospects for the NBA draft. He was forced to sit out his first six games at Pepperdine because of NCAA eligibility concerns but had some impressive showings in the WCC before suffering a season-ending wrist injury in February. Now a sophomore, Lewis is in the midst of a highly productive season, posting 18.7 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.3 blocks and 1.1 steals in 32 minutes per game, shooting 57% inside the arc, 39% for 3 and 85% from the free throw line, putting him firmly on the NBA radar despite his team stumbling to a 5-7 record against Division I competition. Lewis looks the part of an NBA shooting guard, standing 6-7 with a 6-10 wingspan and a thin, but intriguing frame that should be able to carry plenty of weight. He's a fluid mover with long strides, smooth hesitation moves and a wide array of jab-step, rocker-step, crossover and behind-the-back moves that suggest significant talent he has yet to tap into. He finishes creatively around the basket, shows dynamic shot-making prowess inside and outside the arc and finds teammates unselfishly passing off a live dribble or making the right reads out of the pick-and-roll. Lewis makes a handful of tantalizing plays each game of which few prospects are capable. But Lewis has plenty of question marks as well; he lacks a degree of physicality playing through contact, gets to the free throw line infrequently and turns the ball over excessively. He gets targeted mercilessly by low-major opponents, getting scored on so consistently that it suggests both apathy and a clear lack of awareness. Despite this, he can recover for blocks and steals thanks to his length and talent, but he is more or less a sieve. Games against Gonzaga, Saint Mary's, San Francisco and BYU will be important for Lewis to solidify his standing, as his production has fallen off significantly against top-100-caliber competition this season.

He looked reluctant to take open jumpers due to his unconventional shooting mechanics, hit less than 70% of his free throw attempts and posted more turnovers than assists on the season. Lately, Bailey has looked a lot more like the top-five high school recruit he was billed as than the second-round flier most NBA teams viewed him as. He's averaging 17 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 3.6 assists on sparkling efficiency (67% true shooting percentage) over his last five games, including two excellent NCAA tournament showings last weekend. He's playing with much more confidence, showing his excellent ball-handling ability, shiftiness changing speeds and getting in the paint, ability to pass off a live dribble and improved defense. There are still major question marks about his jump shot, but Bailey is doing a good job of rebuilding his stock and putting himself back in the picture as a potential first-round pick depending on how he continues to play and in the pre-draft process should he declare.-- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 Although he might not be the surefire top-five pick his high school ranking suggests, Bailey proved during the high school all-star circuit that he's not just a big name with a massive social media following. Bailey is a competitive, hard-nosed 6-4 guard who brings energy and physicality defensively, can make the type of live-dribble pick-and-roll deliveries you see from today's NBA combo guards, and is willing to do the little things that impact winning -- a recipe for early playing time under Mick Cronin in Westwood. On the flip side, Bailey doesn't quite have the same physical upside as some guards in this class with a similar frame, wingspan (6-7) and leaping ability to Jalen Suggs at the same stage. Because he's not overly rangy with the ball in his hands, Bailey will have to continue improving as a perimeter shooter and finisher around the rim to remain efficient at the collegiate and NBA level. He's capable of rising into midrange pull-ups comfortably, but is still inconsistent from beyond the arc at this stage. With all that said, it's important for fans and scouts alike to try to look at Bailey through a different lens than what his No. 5 high school ranking and Instagram would suggest, because if they don't, they're likely to miss on a really good basketball player -- a two-way competitor who makes winning plays and makes his teammates better. -- ESPN ","This was the fifth and final of the Hornets' selections.

"ESPN","Rayan Rupert",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"France","France",NA,NA,NA,"Feb. 4, 2023 A right wrist fracture caused Rupert to miss two months of action, but he made his return at the beginning of January. He quickly reclaimed his spot in the starting five, having some of his best games of the season recently as the New Zealand Breakers finished their season on a winning streak to claim second place and home-court advantage in the playoffs until the Finals. Rupert seems to have used his time off wisely as he's come back looking far more polished utilizing his left hand and has shown increasing flashes of shot-creation prowess and willingness to attack the rim aggressively looking for contact. Rupert's numbers don't jump off the page, but his maturity on both ends of the floor certainly does. Despite not turning 19 until the end of May, he brings a calming presence to his team's offense with his strong feel for the game and unselfish style, as well as strong defensive versatility and intensity required to play a key role for the NBL's most efficient defense. Rupert's 7-3 wingspan allows him to make a huge impact off the ball, rotating to protect the rim, contesting shots on the perimeter and coming up with plenty of deflections and steals. He's often utilized as a point-of-attack defender, heating up the opposing team's point guard the length of the floor and has little issues switching onto bigger players due to his length, intensity and competitiveness. Every team in the NBA is looking for long-armed wings in Rupert's mold who can defend multiple positions, make good decisions with the ball and switch seamlessly from point guards to power forwards. Rupert's frame needs to continue to fill out, but he's already made significant strides in that department and has the type of shoulders and build that should be able to carry significant weight in the coming years. The next step for Rupert will be to find more consistency from the perimeter, where he's shown flashes of shot-making both off the dribble and with his feet set, but is only making 24% of his 3-pointers. His strong shooting mechanics and the rave reviews he draws off the court for his work ethic and overall approach bode well for his ability to improve here, but it will be difficult for him to reach his full potential until he becomes a more formidable scoring threat. The fact that Rupert has been a key cog for a championship-contending team, something none of his NBL Next Star predecessors such as Josh Giddey, LaMelo Ball or Ousmane Dieng can boast, is clearly a feather in his cap. A huge number of NBA teams have already traveled to New Zealand to scout him in practices and games with more expected to arrive as his team's playoff campaign kicks off later in February. -- Jonathan Givony Nov. 7, 2022 Rupert has solidified his credentials as a potential lottery pick in the Australian NBL by playing an important role in fueling his New Zealand Breakers squad to a 6-3 start that is good for second place and already helping his team win more games than it did all of last season. Unfortunately, Rupert suffered a broken wrist this weekend that will keep him off the court for at least six weeks and might halt the momentum he has built over the past few months. Rupert often starts and/or finishes games and has been an essential part of the Breakers' league-best defense, pressuring opposing point guards the length of the floor and disrupting the opponents' offensive flow with his 7-foot-3 wingspan. After shooting 10-for-16 from 3 in the preseason Australian Blitz, Rupert's jump shot has been streaky since (4-for-20 from 3), and he has similarly struggled to score efficiently inside the arc. Nevertheless, his impact on film clearly exceeds what is suggested by the box score. That the 18-year-old has been able to carve out an important role at a high level of competition while still making enough offensive contributions to stay on the floor is a very good sign for his future. None of his predecessors in the Next Stars program (Josh Giddey, LaMelo Ball, Ousmane Dieng, R.J. Hampton) was able to contribute to winning the way Rupert has in the NBL. Fortunately for the injured Rupert, he hit the ground running in New Zealand and built a strong body of work in his first 12 games for NBA teams to study, although the fact that scouts won't be able to evaluate his progress as a shooter as the season progresses isn't ideal. -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 Rupert is one of the most intriguing international prospects outside the top five in this class thanks to his combination of length (6-6 with a 7-3 wingspan) and shot creation on the perimeter. Rupert, who might still have a few inches of growth ahead of him, is the son of former Euroleague player and national team captain Thierry Rupert, who tragically died in 2013, and the brother of Iliana Rupert, who plays for the French national team and the WNBA's Las Vegas Aces. As a prospect, Rupert is far from a finished product. He's contact-averse, he lives off a lot of tough pull-up 2s, and he's still not a consistent threat from 3 -- he shot just 20% from 3 over four Adidas Next Generation Tournament games in early April. But much like a shorter Brandon Ingram, he can get to his midrange pull-up against even the rangiest of defenders, with an incredibly high release and solid elevation. He's also incredibly disruptive defensively thanks to his excellent hands and elite length, which helped him average 4.0 steals per game at the ANGT in April. Rupert can stand to improve his decision-making, physicality, 3-ball and defensive rebounding, and it remains to be seen where he'll play his draft-eligible season next year -- he's currently finishing up at INSEP, a well-known under-18 academy in France. But few prospects can offer the same type of positional length and shot-creation potential, which gives Rupert lottery upside. -- ESPN Jan. 21, 2022 Arguably the best long-term European prospect outside of Wembanyama is French guard Rayan Rupert, whom I watched go for 21 points, 10 rebounds and 4 steals in a win over Avignon in the French third division. As the leader of a U18 INSEP team competing against professionals, Rupert is incredibly impressive in his all-business approach at just 17 years old, which comes as little surprise as he's the brother of 2021 WNBA draft pick Iliana Rupert and the son of longtime French professional Thierry Rupert, who tragically died in 2013. Physically, Rupert is highly intriguing with Kawhi Leonard-like dimensions, standing 6-6 with a reported 7-3 wingspan, a projectable yet lean frame and the potential to sprout as tall as 6-9. Although he's a streaky shooter, an improving decision-maker and a finesse-reliant finisher lacking physicality, Rupert is a disruptive on-ball defender and has tremendous upside as a shot creator given his ability to rise over top of virtually any guard and get to his patented midrange jumper, even showing some range on pull-up 3s. More long than explosive, Rupert is at an early stage of physical development and shouldn't be expected to be overly productive in his first professional season next year (location still unknown), but he has as high of an upside as any international prospect in this class outside of the No. 1 pick. -- ESPN","With their second first-round pick, the Trail Blazers gave us some more insight into their thought process regarding the balancing act they are trying to pull off between staying competitive in the midst of Damian Lillard's prime, while trying to stockpile talent for when his era in Portland inevitably comes to an end. Player fit Rupert largely fits the 3-and-D profile teams covet, at 6-7 with a 7-2 wingspan and the framework to be a universally helpful role player. He's known as an extremely hard worker and has made some strides with his jumper, leaving room for optimism that he'll make shots and supply plus defense on the wing. Rupert is still raw in some ways, but his feel is pretty solid, and it won't be surprising to see him blossom into a good player given time. His offense is going to be a work in progress, though. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Sidy Cissoko",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"France","France",NA,NA,NA,"Aug. 15, 2022 Cissoko did a little bit of everything for France, averaging 21.4 points, 9.2 rebounds, 6.0 assists and 4.6 steals per 40 minutes. He was a menace by jumping passing lanes and getting anywhere he wanted operating in the open floor. He also used his powerful frame to bounce off opponents, finish through contact and live at the free throw line. Although his handle isn't very advanced and he can be inconsistent with his decision-making, Cissoko proved capable of dishing on the move and making touch passes to teammates in stride for easy baskets, using both hands as a passer and demonstrating nice creativity and vision overall. While streaky, he was able to step into 3-pointers and knock down open jumpers effectively, even demonstrating some potential shooting off movement with strong mechanics. And at 6-foot-7 with a huge frame, Cissoko showed the potential to defend a variety of positions as well as some instincts in making smart rotations to protect the rim and generate turnovers all tournament. At times a little casual with his approach, cutting down on turnovers and showing better focus with his awareness and technique off the ball will be important for Cissoko to shore up his role-playing credentials with G League Ignite next season. He gets beat off the dribble more than you'd like, gambles excessively for steals and will do some head-scratching things with the ball, leading to ill-advised shots or turnovers. While his jumper looks good coming out of his hand, he only made 25% of his attempts, similar to his LEB Gold stats this past season. Cissoko converting 78% of his free throws is encouraging, but teams will want to see him demonstrate better touch as a finisher around the basket, where he lacks a degree of explosiveness. France will surely be disappointed with their fifth-place finish, but there was plenty to be encouraged about regarding Cissoko's performance. He'll likely be more effective with better spacing principles and coaching in the G League than what he saw at this event. May 7, 2022 Cissoko is a powerful 6-7 guard/wing who offers an intriguing blend of strength, court vision and defensive potential. A late bloomer who didn't truly burst onto the scene in Europe until the 2021 U18 European Championships, Cissoko had some tremendous highs playing for Baskonia's second team in LEB Gold, scoring 16 points or more eight times against grown men at just 17 years old. An above-the-rim athlete in Spain, Cissoko didn't look quite as quick or vertically explosive in a Nike Hoop Summit setting, and his lack of wiggle and handle slowed him down in shot-creation situations. But when viewed through the lens of a playmaking wing who doesn't need to be the primary ball handler, Cissoko is quite interesting. With measurements similar to RJ Barrett's at the same stage, Cissoko has the body to guard wings (and even some small-ball 4s) when fully motivated. He's not a consistent shooter right now, converting just 26% of his career 170 3s according to our database, but his mechanics are projectable, and if Cissoko can make just enough spot 3s to force hard closeouts, he'll be able to use his physicality and court vision to add value as a playmaker, as we saw in the Nike Hoop Summit game. Cissoko played with much better defensive energy than we saw at times in LEB Gold action, collecting three steals and one block in just 23 minutes while dazzling with several no-look feeds. He's comfortable in pick-and-roll -- using both sides of the floor as a passer -- even if he can be a bit wild or careless with his decision-making. Overall, Cissoko is still finding his identity as a player. But the French-Senegalese prospect has a solid foundation to work with given his size, strength, defensive potential and playmaking potential. -- ESPN Jan. 21, 2022 French-Senegalese guard Sidy Cissoko is the most talented of the bunch, standing 6-6 with long arms, big hands, a strong 196-pound frame and the ability to create offense for both himself and his teammates. He's a powerful downhill driver who has already finished several poster dunks this season, while also showcasing impressive shot-making potential despite his 29% 3-point clip. Although he can make most pick-and-roll reads when he's going right, Cissoko -- who plays point guard full time for Iraurgi in Spain's second division -- needs to improve his decision-making and handle to play on the ball full time at the highest level. His defensive energy and body language also need major work, and making strides in those areas will be crucial for him to maximize his potential as a top-10 pick. The 17-year-old is under contract with Baskonia in the Basque Region and could earn minutes in the ACB next season. -- ESPN","After picking Victor Wembanyama first overall, the Spurs made their second pick of the night at No. 44, originally acquired from the Toronto Raptors. Player fitAlthough Ignite's other prospects received a bit more fanfare, Cissoko does some interesting things in his own right, as a capable passer, ball handler and shooter with a strong 6-7 frame. He doesn't hang his hat on any particular thing yet, but was reasonably productive in the G League, averaging a steal and a block per game and flashing his versatility. His upside as a big complementary wing offers some appeal in this part of the draft. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Gregory Jackson II",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"South Carolina","SC",NA,NA,NA,"March 9, 2023 Jackson clearly wasn't ready to be a featured option as a just-turned-18-year-old in the SEC, shooting an abysmal 38% from 2-point range and 29% from 3 with nearly three times as many turnovers as assists in conference play. NBA teams say he's one of the more difficult evaluations they've seen in recent years, as it has been difficult to stay optimistic about his long-term outlook considering the poor decision-making, defense and production he has displayed for much of the season. Even more alarming has been the way Jackson has responded to his own struggles, be it calling out his coaching staff on social media from the locker room or displaying poor body language on the sidelines on multiple occasions, indicating a distinct lack of maturity. Jackson has gone from being the No. 1 recruit in his high school class to no sure thing as far as hearing his name called in the first round, meaning he has a significant amount of work ahead of him during the pre-draft process to alleviate the concerns around him if he indeed elects to enter the NBA draft. -- Jonathan Givony Feb. 4, 2023 Jackson has proven to be one of the toughest evals in this draft class according to NBA scouts, mixing in flashes of brilliance with long stretches of inefficient and ineffective play. The youngest player in college basketball, Jackson just barely made the cut for eligibility in the 2023 NBA draft by 15 days. He reclassified late, decommitted from North Carolina, and elected to stay close to home by enrolling at South Carolina, who is 1-8 in SEC play and one of the worst teams in high-major basketball. After playing primarily at center in high school and on Nike EYBL grassroots circuit, Jackson has reinvented himself as a small forward in college, living off a steady diet of difficult pull-up jumpers out of isolation and pick-and-roll. The results have been decidedly mixed, with Jackson converting just 42% of his 2-pointers, 33% of his 3s, and 64% of his free throw attempts, making him the second least-efficient scorer of any college player in our Top 100. He's also posting three times as many turnovers as assists, making for a very difficult watching experience and helping to explain some of his team's considerable struggles this season. Defensively, things have been even worse. He gives very little effort, looking very upright in his stance, not covering ground well, struggling to get over screens and looking lethargic with his reaction time, providing next to nothing as a rim-protector due to his poor 6-11 wingspan. Jackson played with good effort in previous settings, leading the Nike EYBL in rebounding with 10.2 per game in 20 contests, but South Carolina's coaching staff hasn't been able to coax much effort or physicality out of him, with his body language looking very concerning at times. Jackson's talent is undeniable, especially considering he recently turned 18. Few players in the college game demonstrate the type of range and shot-making prowess he does dribbling the ball up and rising up from impossible vantage points. He is a powerful finisher who shows some potential as a shot-creator, but everything he does looks entirely disconnected from his team, and it's hard to ascertain how long it will take to reprogram him and get him to play winning basketball in a different environment. Workouts and especially interviews, where Jackson is certain to excel, will likely help assuage some of the concerns about the way this season has looked, but it wouldn't hurt to show some growth prior to that, especially at the SEC tournament, which will be heavily attended by NBA decision makers and will be the last impression most have of him in a 5-on-5 setting. -- Jonathan Givony Oct. 4, 2022 One of the front-runners for the mantle of No. 1 prospect in the high school class of 2023, GG Jackson's decision to graduate high school early, enroll at South Carolina and become NBA draft eligible next June surprised very few people who had closely followed his recruitment. Not turning 18 until the middle of December, Jackson is one of the youngest players in college basketball but is coming off an uneven spring and summer that made him somewhat of a polarizing prospect among scouts who don't seem to unanimously hold him in quite the same esteem as his lofty recruiting rankings when projecting to the NBA. Some of that is due to the fact that Jackson is leaving an underwhelming 2023 high school class to enter a 2023 draft that is as deep and talented as we've seen in recent years. Another reason is positional concerns, as Jackson doesn't have elite size or length for a big man, measuring 6-7.5 barefoot with a wingspan under 6-11, dimensions that will make it difficult for him to slide up in the NBA to the center position that he mostly played in high school, without the requisite two-way skill set to compensate. Jackson has a long way to go with defensive versatility and awareness on the perimeter, as he's not the most physical interior player or a natural rim protector, often looking a step slow to react to things happening around him. He's not much of a creator offensively in terms of his ballhandling or passing, looking at his best finishing plays around the rim or stepping into open 3-pointers, which he has proved very capable of making. Working in Jackson's favor is his impressive explosiveness in the paint, his growing comfort as a perimeter shooter, the excellent intensity he operates with, his youth, and the strong reviews he draws off the court. He'll be asked to shoulder a heavy load for a South Carolina team that saw quite a bit of turnover from last season, including introducing a new coach in Lamont Paris from Chattanooga. Jackson will likely take his lumps early as he transitions from the high school game to college, and how much he's able to grow as the season moves along will help determine if he can emerge as a lottery-level prospect, or perhaps ends up more of a lower-end first-round pick. --Jonathan Givony","After trading away the 25th pick, Memphis entered the night with only its two second-rounders to play with.     Player fit Entering draft night, there was quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding Jackson, who was unable to boost his stock in the pre-draft process and looked susceptible to falling into the second round, despite his lofty recruiting ranking. Teams were concerned about Jackson's readiness both from a skill and from a maturity perspective, but in this part of the draft, he looks like a more appealing, lower-risk project. He's physically gifted with good shooting ability for a guy his size, but has to next figure out what his ideal role is, some of which will fall on the Grizzlies as they develop him from here. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"ESPN","Jordan Miller",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Miami","MIA",NA,NA,NA,"March 27, 2023 Miller had his best college game Sunday, leading Miami to a 13-point second-half comeback over Texas to make the school's first Final Four appearance. He had 27 points on 7-for-7 shooting and went 13-for-13 from the free throw line. Miami repeatedly cleared out the floor and asked Miller to take Timmy Allen, Christian Bishop and Brock Cunningham off the dribble one-on-one, something he did with great success to get to the rim and finish with his left hand. When Texas responded by sending help, Miller showed off his passing mettle with nifty bounce passes out of pick-and-roll or a jump-pass kickout for an open 3-pointer. Miller's performance was impressive, but it's difficult to see how translatable his game is to what his role would be in the NBA. Miller is a career 33% 3-point shooter on a pretty low volume of attempts throughout his five-year college career, sporting awkward lefty mechanics that might not translate to the NBA line. He has versatility mirroring smaller players on the perimeter and staying in front of guards, but doesn't have much size or bulk at 6-foot-7 and 195 pounds to seamlessly play as a big man, and likely at 23 years old doesn't have much more physical development in front of him.

"ESPN","Emoni Bates",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Eastern Michigan","EMU",NA,NA,NA,"March 9, 2023  Bates wasn't able to get Eastern Michigan into the MAC tournament, as his team went 5-13 in conference play and 8-23 overall, meaning his season ended March 3. Bates had some moments, dropping a combined 66 points against South Carolina and Michigan, but was more or less a net negative in conference play He posted a paltry 49% true shooting percentage with far more turnovers than assists and while being a sieve defensively, often looking like he was barely trying while playing selfish basketball. This probably wasn't what NBA scouts or Bates envisioned when he elected to transfer from Memphis last spring, and he has work ahead of him now to be a sure-fire draft pick if he enters. Standing 6-9 and having just turned 19 years old in late January, Bates' tough shot-making prowess and overall scoring instincts hold some appeal, but he plays such a losing brand of basketball on both ends of the floor, making him a relatively tough sell. -- Jonathan Givony Oct 4, 2022 Emoni Bates, previously the No. 33 prospect in our 2023 mock in June, is now off our projection altogether following his arrest for carrying a concealed weapon and ""altering ID marks"" on a firearm and subsequent suspension from Eastern Michigan. The 18-year-old is coming off a disappointing, injury-plagued freshman season at Memphis that resulted in his decision to transfer closer to home. Should his legal issues be cleared and he successfully returns to the court and shows glimpses of what made him such a highly touted prospect entering college, he'll likely receive strong consideration in future iterations. -- Jonathan Givony May 7, 2022 Bates, one of the most hyped high school prospects in recent history, had a difficult freshman year at Memphis, shooting just 44% from 2-point range, 33% from 3 and posting nearly twice as many turnovers as assists. Bates is on the move after electing to enter the transfer portal, with first-year coach Kenny Payne and Louisville considered the favorites to land his services. Still only 18, Bates' ability to gain strength and maximize his explosiveness will be major keys to reaching his potential, as he really struggled with the physicality of the college game, clearly lacking much in the way of elite length, quickness or vertical pop to play the wild style of basketball he was accustomed to at lower levels. While his energy defensively was solid, his weak frame, average awareness and the lack of experience and high-level coaching he had received to this point in his career clearly worked against him on this end too. Bates still shows flashes of terrific scoring instincts, aggressiveness and shot-making prowess that aren't that easy to find with a 6-foot-9 18-year-old. Finding ways to slow down, simplify things and hopefully shed the expectations that were put on him as a 14-year old-will be major keys to solidifying himself in the first-round conversation and maybe beginning to make up some of the ground he lost in the past two years. -- Jonathan Givony Jan. 21, 2022 The prospect most in need of a strong close to the season and big summer to enter the 2023 lottery conversation is 6-9 Memphis wing Emoni Bates. Once considered a future top pick as a young teen, Bates is now slotted at 20th overall with questions looming about his decision-making, frame, defensive awareness and overall ability to play through contact given his lack of length, physicality, burst and vertical pop. It's been a tough adjustment for the 17-year-old coming from a non-powerhouse high school without any FIBA experience to the collegiate level, as he has committed twice as many turnovers as assists while shooting just 35% at the rim in the half court. As I said on the Memphis-Alabama broadcast, the media (myself included) is also to blame for comparing a young teenager to future Hall of Famers. With that said, it's time for Bates to recalibrate expectations, simplify his game and start building on the things he does well while addressing his shortcomings. When I was in Memphis earlier this season, Bates had an excellent practice by running the floor hard, making catch-and-shoot 3s, creating offense as a cutter and bringing energy defensively, free of all the pressure to try to become the next Kevin Durant. That's the template for him moving forward -- more singles, less home runs. Bates is now up to 35% from 3 this season, and his shooting touch is his clear NBA skill. LA Clippers rookie Brandon Boston Jr. is a nice archetype for him as a shot-making wing who can catch fire both with his feet set and on the move. Although Bates' focus off the ball defensively needs work, he has a competitive energy about him that could manifest in becoming a more impactful defender and plus rebounder. He'll also show glimpses as an open-court playmaker when he's not sped up. Where Bates spends his draft-eligible season will play a big role in his development and NBA outlook as being held accountable is imperative for future success. Whether he's at Memphis or at an alternative pathway like Overtime Elite or the G League Ignite -- where he'd benefit from playing off potential top pick Henderson -- scouts will have a close eye on Bates' development. -- ESPN Oct. 12, 2021 Emoni Bates showed both his youth and talent in what was most NBA executives' first live look at the ballyhooed 17-year-old. Running the point extensively for Memphis, Bates showed his advanced scoring instincts, budding playmaking ability and craft as a big guard. There were extreme highs -- complicated sequences of polished footwork and changes of speed operating out of hesitation moves to get to the rim for explosive finishes. There were also lows -- moments of overdribbling, missed passes, blown defensive assignments and questionable shot selection -- which have characterized Bates' game since he first emerged as a 14-year-old. It's clear that Bates has put in serious work into adding bulk to his lanky frame -- he's up to 190 pounds, nearly 20 pounds more than two years ago -- and has made a conscious effort to play the game unselfishly and get others involved. His energy and intensity was infectious, and he's obviously well-liked by teammates and the coaching staff. Despite the added bulk, much was made of the poor measurements and athletic testing data (conducted by the same outfit that works the NBA combine) Bates posted. He measured a wingspan nearly 2 inches shorter than his height, with small hands, and a paltry 24.5-inch standing and 31.5-inch running vertical leap, as well as very slow sprint times. His closest NBA comparison in our measurements database is Atlanta Hawks' wing Kevin Huerter. Bates' lack of length was already well known, and many of the concerns about his athletic testing data were eased as executives watched him put his head on the rim on several impressive finishes in drills and live action. Bates is not the fastest or most explosive player around, which is why continuing to add bulk is going to be important. BA scouts had mixed first impressions. Some called Bates overrated, comparing what they saw (unfairly) to the unrealistic ""next KD"" expectations that were placed on him when he was 14. Others were enthusiastic about the overall package of shot-making, bucket-getting prowess, notable team spirit and some of the impressive passes he made off a live dribble. It's important to remember that Bates will play most of this upcoming season as a 17-year-old, and his age is the reason he won't be eligible for the NBA draft until 2023. He's more than seven years younger than teammate DeAndre Williams, has no real experience at the position he's being asked to play, and has basically never been coached. While there's plenty to nitpick, and it's obvious that Bates' transition to the point guard position will be an up-and-down process, there's no question that this season (and the following one if he decides to stay) will be outstanding for his long-term development, giving him the type of reps and hard coaching he needs to expand his game and break free of many of the bad habits acquired earlier in his career. Bates had a much stronger practice the second day, which included plenty of live scrimmaging, compared with the first, which was more heavily attended by high-level decision-makers. Compared to what we saw this past summer, where Bates really struggled with efficiency and decision-making, this was an encouraging showing, confirming his status as one of the best prospects in the 2023 NBA draft. -- Jonathan Givony Aug. 25, 2021 Bates' decision-making and overall scoring efficiency are the things NBA teams will want to see improve in college. While he scored 21 points in 28 minutes at the Nike EYBL this summer, he did it shooting just 43% from 2 and 28% for 3 with a near 1-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio. Bates had the freedom to take as many off-balance shots as he wanted in high school and AAU, which either led to poor performances when his step-backs weren't falling or impressive moments when they were. Memphis is deep, experienced and talented. Hardaway will surely ask him to play a very different role this season, likely leaning on his ability to get others involved, something that he can absolutely do. I watched him dish nine assists at the EYBL in a win over PSA Cardinals, as he impressed with the way he passed ahead and found teammates on the move out of pick and roll, even if he finished 4-of-15 from the field. Where Memphis will help Bates improve is on defense. It wouldn't be surprising to see them emerge as the best defensive team in college considering the size, experience, versatility and playmaking they have at every position. Bates' effort level defensively was inconsistent as a prep player, especially off the ball. He'll be pushed on defense and will be asked to be more physical and intense than ever before, which will be great for his development. He has long been considered a fiery competitor with a mean streak -- that bodes well for his ability to become a competent defender when combined with his excellent instincts. It will be interesting to see how Bates stacks up physically with his peers at the college level. Bates, 17, will face an uphill battle going up against players in their early 20s on a nightly basis, but he has added little bulk to his 183-pound frame since he emerged on the scene in 2018. NBA scouts who watched Bates at the EYBL were surprised at how he struggled to beat opponents off the dribble and finish around the basket. His lack of strength should improve, but how explosive he is and how capable he is to finish in traffic will be something scouts pay close attention to as well. -- Jonathan Givony May 4, 2021 The most impressive aspect of Bates' game is definitely his shot-making ability, especially when paired with his size -- somewhere between 6-foot-8 and 6-9. He has incredible range on his jumper, and is extremely versatile and dynamic with the way he gets into it, showing the ability to pull up sharply from implausible vantage points, while dribbling full-speed with outstanding balance. The footwork Bates shows getting into step backs as well as coming off screens in small doses is extremely impressive as well. You simply can't give him any space on the perimeter. Synergy Sports Tech has 10 high school games logged this season where Bates made 38% of his 3-pointers, which is very impressive considering the extremely high degree of difficulty of many of his attempts -- 78% of his shots have come off the dribble. Bates also has a polished arsenal of ball-handling moves for a 17-year old. He loves to operate off double crossovers to create space to get into the lane and he has a really soft touch on his floaters. He's a fluid athlete who can use or reject a ball screen skillfully and shows some glimpses of court vision and playmaking ability off a live dribble in very small doses. Bates also plays the game with a major chip on his shoulder, as he's an aggressive, emotional and competitive player who is wired to use his exceptional scoring instincts to their fullest for every minute he's on the court. The first time I saw Bates was nearly three years ago at a USA Basketball camp. Then a 14-year-old, he put on a show against players much older than him and raised eyebrows not only with his incredible scoring instincts but also the fact that he measured 6-8.5 in shoes, with a 168-pound frame. Fast-forward nearly three years, it doesn't appear that Bates has changed much physically. He's now listed at 6-9 and a perhaps generous 190 pounds, while sporting a lean, narrow frame that may struggle to put on weight long-term and reminds me somewhat of Brandon Ingram at the same age. While Ingram has a 7-3 wingspan, Bates' wingspan was measured at 6-9 at several events, which is a completely different ballpark. Another player with whom Bates draws comparisons, Jayson Tatum, weighed 206 pounds when he was 17 and measured a 6-11 wingspan. With his peers having caught up physically, Bates' lack of strength was apparent all weekend long. He struggled to finish through contact in the lane and wasn't physical enough looking to draw fouls and get to the free throw line. He shot just 4-of-15 inside the arc in his matchup with No. 2-ranked Jalen Duren and Team Final in the showcase game of the weekend in Indianapolis, not getting to the free throw line and posting just two assists compared with seven turnovers. Bates did shoot 6-of-16 from 3 (38%) in that game, though. Things looked fairly similar in the two other contests we took in last weekend as well. Like Ingram, Bates is a good athlete, not an exceptional one, and he struggled to create space with his first step at times and often needed quite a few dribbles to get his shot off, usually a midrange pull-up or a difficult double-clutch floater. Team Final (and Each 1 Teach 1, which also did a good job of slowing him) took a similar approach to some of the best teams Bates' high school faced this season, putting a tall, quick-footed defender on him on the perimeter, forcing him to shoot over length all game long and then crowding him with help on his drives and forcing him to beat them with his passing. At times, he had a double-team sent his way as soon as he crossed half court. This is the area where Bates has the most room for growth, as he made questionable decisions all weekend in terms of shot selection and wild forays to the rim that resulted in a considerable number of turnovers. Going up against some of the best grassroots teams and players in the country, it's important to note that Bates' squad was considerably overmatched talentwise every time they stepped on the floor, forcing him to shoulder a very heavy offensive load that certainly contributed to his inefficiency. At times, his competitiveness and incredible self-belief worked against him. Just how good is Bates' feel for the game? How does his style of play project to contribute to winning down the road? Has he missed opportunities to develop his knowledge of the game due to the lack of high-level coaching he's received thus far and the poor level of talent surrounding him? These are all fair questions being asked by evaluators. Becoming less predictable with his moves, developing counters when cut off, learning to simplify the game, read the floor better and not just settling for the first shot he can find will be major priorities for him moving forward to reach his sky-high potential. Bates also has work to do on the defensive end, where his effort ranged from disappointing to downright dreadful at times. He mostly stands around off the ball, rarely getting into a stance or showing any type of fight getting over screens or back into plays after being beaten off the dribble. He's not very physical getting on the defensive glass where his lack of length and bulk shows. It's not rare for players this age to show little effort on the defensive end, but it's certainly something he can address to become a more well-rounded player who contributes to winning when his tough jumpers aren't falling. -- Jonathan Givony Oct. 9, 2018 With the 2022 NBA draft potentially featuring high schoolers for the first time since 2005, evaluating the camp's youngest class held a little more importance than usual, and 14-year-old forward Emoni Bates looks like the ideal prospect to end the one-and-done era with a bang. The 6-foot-8 Bates turned heads all weekend, looking the part of a potential future No. 1 pick. Although you never want to jump the gun on a player so young, Bates appears to be the rare exception. A head-at-the-rim athlete with the agility of a wing and handle of a guard, Bates was also the camp's best shooter, cashing contested pull-up 3s with such fluidity and confidence that it was hard not to liken him to a young Kevin Durant. The majority of lean wing prospects model their games after Durant, but Bates -- who averaged 40 PPG as a seventh-grader and skipped his eighth-grade season to train -- has the talent to back it up. ""We're both skinny, lanky, we can both score,"" Bates said of Durant. ""We're skinny, but we're wiry strong."" The Michigan native also has a sound feel for the game and went through drills with energy and personality. He came into the camp as the top eighth-grader in the nation, already with an AAU team to his name (Bates Fundamentals), with several class of 2022 prospects whispering ""overrated"" amongst themselves, some even challenging Bates on social media. Bates answered the call in a big way, shining as the top long-term prospect regardless of age. NBA teams -- which weren't allowed to scout this event -- will undoubtedly start doing their homework on Bates, as he showed flashes of franchise-changing potential. Of course, a lot can change between now and the 2022 draft. We've seen highly touted young prospects fail to live up to expectations time and time again. Allonzo Trier was billed as the top 13-year-old in the country. He spent three years in college and went undrafted last June. The attention that comes along with being as talented as Bates could change even the mentally strongest teenage phenoms, which is a big reason why we often wait to dive too deep into players this age. But Bates is simply too talented to ignore. -- ESPN ","This is Cleveland's only selection on draft night, with the Cavs hoping a player high on their board would unexpectedly fall to them here.    Player fit Bates' long journey from projected top pick to enigmatic college player to potentially undrafted will be interesting to monitor from here, as he indeed hears his name called by Cavaliers, but will have to work to earn a place in the team's future plans. Bates has size, he can shoot, and plays hard, but offers little in the way of defense or playmaking, and ultimately never made a compelling case for himself as someone worthy of guaranteed money on draft night. The Cavaliers will give him a chance and see whether he can adjust and find a role that works. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Keyontae Johnson",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kansas State","KSU",NA,NA,NA,"March 27, 2023 Johnson's NCAA tournament run was more inconsistent than one might expect relative to Kansas State's Elite Eight finish, sandwiching two average showings by his standards against Kentucky and Florida Atlantic with one strong performance against Michigan State, perhaps missing an opportunity to better solidify his standing as a first-round candidate. There's a lot to like about Johnson's profile as a 6-6 combo forward who can stretch the floor (41% from 3), finish lobs or cuts with explosiveness at the rim and offer some multi-positional defensive versatility with his 230-pound frame, toughness and length. Every NBA team more or less is looking to add players in this mold to their rosters, and the fact he's turning 23 doesn't hurt him, considering he spent almost two years away from basketball dealing with a heart issue. Johnson went just 3-for-11 on 3-pointers and 5-for-9 from the free throw line in four NCAA tournament games, settled for tough shots, made questionable decisions and had some costly lapses off the ball defensively in highlighting his average processing speed and feel for the game. He's a little more theoretical at times than one might hope for a fifth-year senior, but NBA teams will likely account for his time away from the game and consider he could very well still be shaking the rust off. While Johnson might not have helped his cause to be considered a sure-fire first-rounder, he's a legitimate option in the second round and shows enough glimpses of ability on both ends of the floor to be a player for NBA teams to buy into at a position of need.-- Jonathan Givony March 14, 2023 After sitting out nearly two years due to a heart issue that led to a scary on-court collapse that required surgery, Johnson became a first-team All-Big 12 player and newcomer of the year, leading Kansas State to a surprise NCAA tournament appearance. Johnson also revitalized his draft stock in a major way as a mismatch forward who scores inside and out, is powerful attacking in a straight line and hits 42% of his 3-pointers. Johnson's length and chiseled frame give him the ability to slide up to the power forward spot and even moonlight as a small-ball center at times. Set to turn 23 years old in May, Johnson's previous health issues will be scrutinized by NBA teams and the league office in the pre-draft process, similar to Jared Butler several years ago. Johnson demonstrates average explosiveness, awareness and decision-making on both ends of the floor. Johnson and Kansas State faded somewhat after an excellent start to the season, so finding a way to finish strong would certainly help build some momentum going into the spring.-- Jonathan Givony","Oklahoma City made three picks on Thursday, selecting Dereck Lively II at No. 12 overall and Hunter Tyson at No. 37. Player fitAfter a heart condition caused him to collapse on the court in December 2020, Johnson has been medically cleared to play by the NBA, a key step for him as he worked to find an opportunity in the draft. Ultimately, these types of situations still require team doctors to sign off on the selection, which limits the number of potential landing spots. The Thunder felt comfortable enough with Johnson to invest a pick in him here, hoping he can turn into a useful utility player who contributes defensively and on the glass. -- Jeremy Woo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"ESPN","Jalen Wilson",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kansas","KU",NA,NA,NA," March 14, 2023 Wilson exploded in his fourth season of college basketball, emerging as the Big 12 player of the year for defending national champions Kansas and helping the Jayhawks to not miss a beat from last season. Wilson is their unquestioned go-to guy, shouldering a significant offensive load with varying degrees of efficiency, scoring inside the post, in the open floor, with mid-post isos and out of pick-and-rolls. Wilson plays a different role than the one he'd likely be asked to play in the NBA, and the question scouts will ask is whether he can become a good enough spot-up shooter, one-on-one defender and decision-maker with less offensive responsibility. At 6-foot-7 with very little length and explosiveness, Wilson isn't blessed with huge upside, so finishing on a strong note will be important. The Jayhawks have a tough draw, playing several pro prospects on either Arkansas or Illinois in the second round should they advance past Howard, as expected.-- Jonathan Givony Dec. 12, 2020 A broken ankle suffered 30 seconds into Wilson's second game derailed his freshman season at Kansas, causing him to redshirt with just three minutes of playing time. He has been making up for lost time, averaging 15.7 points on 26.5 minutes per game and emerging as the Jayhawks' go-to guy while surprisingly leading the team in scoring. Wilson came up huge in a pair of wins over Kentucky and Creighton last week, dropping a combined 46 points while making six of 11 from 3-point range. His strong, 6-foot-8 frame and aggressiveness crashing the glass have been key for Kansas, with the ability to go small with him at center. How sustainable that is -- and what it means for Wilson's timeline as an NBA prospect -- is to be determined after just six games. But it's clear that he has some type of NBA future as a 6-foot-8 power forward who can knock down out-of-rhythm 3-pointers while showing the ability to score in the open floor. The fact that he has registered a single block and no steals in 159 minutes will surely give NBA teams pause, and his on-court decision-making at points has left something to be desired. But Kansas has sent 18 players to the NBA draft in the past decade, and if Wilson is going to be the team's best offensive player as a redshirt freshman this season, the NBA is likely in his future. -- Jonathan Givony","Player fit Wilson had a strong couple of seasons at Kansas, playing a big role on the Jayhawks' 2022 championship team and then stepping up as a scorer last season after Ochai Agbaji and Christian Braun left for the NBA. He didn't have an overwhelming pre-draft process and presumably wasn't helped by the fact he measured under 6-6 barefoot at the combine.

Clark put his defensive prowess on full display earlier this month with a comprehensive shutdown of Kentucky freshman and projected top-10 pick Cason Wallace, under the watchful eyes of many NBA executives at Madison Square Garden, limiting him to seven points, zero assists and two turnovers on 2-for-13 shooting in UCLA's win. Clark's combination of length, strength, quickness and intensity is highly impactful, as he regularly steps in for charges, helps off the ball and wreaks havoc getting in passing lanes and crashing the glass. He ranks first in steals among all prospects in the top 100 and is tops among guards in rebounding, but has also found ways to be productive offensively as well, averaging 22 points per 40 on an efficient 66% true shooting percentage while rarely turning the ball over. Most of his offense comes in transition, posting up and attacking closeouts on straight-line drives, but he has also shown some flashes of effectiveness overpowering weaker defenders off the dribble, finishing through contact and splashing open 3-pointers, hitting 11-for-28 from beyond the arc through 12 games. Despite the improved play, Clark has some things to prove in Pac-12 play, specifically how translatable or sustainable his offensive game is. He's an average ball handler and passer who plays a lot of bully ball, using his strong frame, and sports a big windup on his stiff spot-up 3-pointer, needing time to get his jumper off and struggling when asked to shoot off the bounce. He's a career 63% free throw shooter and 31% from beyond the arc but has tremendous touch around the basket that indicates he has room to grow in this area. Already playing a similar role to the one he'd be asked to play in the NBA, Clark is in an outstanding situation to help UCLA to a deep NCAA tournament run, which would put him in position to hear his name called on draft night. -- Jonathan Givony","The Timberwolves have only second-round picks after moving most of their first-rounders to Utah in the Rudy Gobert trade.

"The Ringer","Zion Williamson",NA,NA,NA,79,285,"Duke",NA,"Capable of running pick-and-roll as a ball handler; the team that drafts him can use him in virtually any role on offense. A potential five-position defender with a rare combination of strength, agility, and anticipation skills; he can comfortably switch on-ball screens. Zion’s explosive jukes and hop-steps are glitches in the laws of physics; a player his size shouldn’t be able to create separation the way he does. A wrecking-ball finisher who can finish through and above contact; his size, athleticism, and ballhandling ability will lead to a lot of defensive fouls drawn. Dangerous on dives to the rim via pick-and-rolls and handoffs; he can flush lobs like DeAndre Jordan or pass on the short roll like Draymond Green. A smart, unselfish passer who thrives in transition; he lacks supreme vision, but his excellent rebounding and coast-to-coast ability are valuable tools. Punishes smaller players on perimeter drives and post-ups. Has basic moves now, but displays the dexterity and body control necessary to improve. An active and aware cutter who can exploit holes in defenses, even when they sag off him on the perimeter. Hustles and plays with a winning mind-set: dives for loose balls, rebounds out of his area, and pursues chasedown blocks. Defensive playmaker who alters shots and jumps passing lanes to spark transition chances, though in a pro system he’ll have to gamble less frequently. MINUSES Clunky spot-up shooting mechanics; he brings the ball to his set point too early, which hurts momentum into his shot. Also needs to kick his strange habit of jab-stepping before he shoots. Developing a jumper off the dribble is the key to unlocking his full potential; he shoots the ball flat and looks uncomfortable even from the elbow. Must learn how to change gears to minimize sloppy passes or out-of-control drives that lead to charges. He can be predictable: He overuses the drop step on post-ups, and he rarely uses his right hand on shots near the rim. He needs a more diverse arsenal of moves on drives and post-ups. Defensive awareness could use fine-tuning; often falls into upright stance, ball-watches, and misses help rotations. Defensive discipline is lacking; though he makes explosive plays, savvy opponents will throw moves that make him leave his feet, or crash the boards when he overhelps. With his size and explosiveness, health is always a question: He suffered a right foot bruise in high school that put him in a walking boot, sprained his MCL at Duke, and has been out of shape in the past.

Major potential as a transition threat with his handle, speed, and unselfish passing ability. Touch from the line and around the rim suggests he could be a good shooter if he makes the necessary mechanical changes. Terrific athlete who explodes for open-floor dunks and has the top-gear speed to zoom by defenders. Crafty finisher who absorbs contact well, though he still must get stronger.

Not an above-the-rim finisher in traffic, and he avoids using his off hand; converts on plays around the rim at a much lower rate than you’d expect. Telegraphs too many passes; he plays a casual overall game, and needs to put zip on the ball to get it where he wants it to go.

Switchable defender who can potentially lock down multiple positions due to his strength and raw quickness—but only if his fundamentals dramatically improve. Stout defender against bigs and larger forwards due to length and strength; he’s hard to move with his strong base. Good rebounder at the wing thanks to his athleticism. Lob threat off cuts. He could also be used as a roller in the pick-and-roll due to his explosiveness and ability to absorb and finish through contact. Comfortable attacking closeouts to get to the rim. Shows flashes pulling up from short midrange. He’s also a good free throw shooter, which suggests he has long-term 3-point upside. MINUSES Flaky off-ball defender who loses track of his man due to ball-watching, fails to help, and has trouble navigating screens. Gets caught out of position too often defending quicker players, which leads to blow-bys. He’s too much of a turnstile for a player with his physical profile and effort level. Adding weight in college has allowed him to be a big for UNC, but it’s sapped him of the lateral quickness that made him an elite high school defender. Looks puzzled on offense.

With a wide frame, he should get significantly stronger, which will help him finish against contact, rebound, and defend the interior. Good free throw shooter who also has soft touch on hook shots from the short midrange; there’s a chance he could someday develop a spot-up jumper. Has the potential to become an elite rim protector: alters shots with his mere presence, and his long wingspan allows him to clog passing lanes. Excellent lateral quickness defending on the perimeter. May one day be able to switch, or defend pick-and-rolls regardless of the coverage.

He has confidence in his stepback jumper, which could someday be his go-to shot. Showed solid passing instincts and a greater willingness to create for others after returning from a foot injury in February. Great rebounder and shot blocker for his position, since he’s such a quick leaper. Potentially a super versatile defender given his agility and strength—so long as his defensive fundamentals improve and he stays locked in. MINUSES Shooting form has issues: It’s a low, flat release, and there is a lot of lower body movement; inconsistent landings may be the cause of his inconsistencies, especially off the catch. Inactive off-ball player, though that might’ve been a symptom of the college offense he played in.

He’s particularly comfortable making left-handed passes off the dribble. Avoided careless turnovers despite being forced into being a primary playmaker; he won’t have the same role in the NBA, but his skills will make him a tough cover in the pick-and-roll. Didn’t play with a point guard, which hurt his percentages: He shot 34.6 percent in two years on catch-and-shoot jumpers, which isn’t good but it’s something to build on. Good rebounder considering his underdeveloped body, though stronger bigs will move him off his spots until he adds muscle. Impressive defensive potential once his fundamentals improve: He’s mobile moving laterally and plays hard, plus has the length and reaction time to contain guards and wings. Good shot blocker who can alter perimeter jumpers and recover when beaten to swat away shots from behind; he’s an attentive off-ball defender who steps up for weakside blocks, too. MINUSES Lacks physicality and avoids contact; he gets pushed around a lot. He had a late growth spurt, so either he’s just adjusting to his new body or lacks a degree of toughness. He should be considered no more than a theoretical shooting threat because of his average touch near the rim and his subpar percentages on his jumper and from the line. Must do a better job of establishing post positioning, especially when sealing defenders underneath the basket on cuts and rim runs. Thin frame allows beefier players to plow through him on the post and perimeter drives; he needs to get significantly stronger to effectively defend bigs.

Terrific spot-up shooter, despite his funky mechanics. If his screening improves, he’ll become a pick-and-pop weapon. Tantalizing upside as a scorer off the dribble; few bigs can dribble and shoot as well as he does. However, his lack of strength and burst do limit his upside creating against a set defense. Flashes post upside with basic moves that culminate in a right hook. He’ll need to get stronger to carve out space closer to the rim. Potential deterrent around the rim due to his sheer length. He’s so long that his presence can alter opponents’ shots. He’s mobile when he chooses to be. MINUSES Poor shot selection: He floats too much on the perimeter and settles for jumpers off the dribble. While that’s the most tantalizing area of his game, he needs to rein it in for now. Beanpole frame hinders his screening; he barely ever makes contact, since defenders can so easily sneak around him. Putting actual effort into his screens would pay dividends. Slow to react to pressure when playing in the post; it often seems like he doesn’t realize that passing the ball is an option. Poor effort plagues his defense: He fails to contest shots, help, communicate, and box out for rebounds. You won’t find him hustling back on defense. Lacks fundamentals; he plays high defending the post and can’t get low on the perimeter, which probably isn’t solvable due to his high center of gravity.

Projects as a capable perimeter defender if his fundamentals improve. He lacks discipline, but has mobility recovering to his man laterally.

He has good footwork no matter the situation; he’s a patient post scorer yet a decisive attacker against closeouts or when rolling to the rim via cuts and screens. Active off-ball player who cuts, runs the floor hard in transitions, and relocates to get open for 3s; he’d be best suited for a fast-paced, motion-based offense. Instinctual rebounder, especially on offense, though on defense he must commit to boxing out. Could become a threat to throw outlets or grab and go to spark a break.

High-effort on-ball defender with solid fundamentals and nimble foot speed moving laterally against wings. He’s a competitor who will take a charge or dive for a loose ball. Reliable off-ball defender who makes proper rotations and doesn’t ball-watch. His awareness is top-notch, which shows in his instincts jumping passing lanes for deflections and steals.

Made drastic improvements as a passer as a sophomore; he puts velocity on the ball and can effectively facilitate on the short roll and in the low and high post.

He also is capable shooting 3s off one or two dribbles, though it’s a limited sample. Capable post scorer who can use his big frame to bury defenders underneath the rim; he’s also a reliable passer, so perhaps he could develop as a post playmaking presence.

Rim protector who hustles for chase-down and weakside blocks; he rotates like he has an innate feel for the play before it happens. An excellent defensive rebounder who can make an outlet pass or take the ball coast to coast himself. Herky-jerky ball handler who uses in-out dribbles and hesitations to penetrate the paint; he can run pick-and-roll and be relied on to make the simple play and difficult cross-court passes. Good screener who could thrive on the short roll, unselfishly passing to open shooters or attacking the basket himself, where he can finish with either hand through contact. Displayed a willingness to change by overhauling his shooting mechanics after transferring; if he learns to shoot, he’ll be tough to handle when attacking closeouts.

He’s a flat-footed shooter, though his soft touch suggests potential room for significant improvement from 3 and the line. Good ball handler for his size who’s a threat to shoot off the dribble. He’s fluid when transitioning into pull-up and stepback jumpers, or taking the ball to the rim. Has a nose for the ball on rebounds, especially on the offensive boards, where he often chases his own misses.

Displays major potential as an off-the-dribble 3-point shooter with Hardenesque moves. Added a stepback and sidestep 3 to his arsenal and uses hesitations to get into pull-ups.

A freight train in transition; though his shot selection was iffy at Georgia, wide-open spacing in the NBA could lead to far more shots at the rim. Solid passer. Doesn’t possess elite court vision, and tends to react rather than create opportunities for teammates, but he can execute basic reads to shooters and cutters. Potentially a super-versatile defender thanks to his rare blend of size, strength, and agility. MINUSES Not a pure shooter; he settles for jumpers even against mismatches, which is especially frustrating for a player with his size and strength. Best suited to be in a multiple-ball-handler system next to a pass-first player because of his underwhelming playmaking instincts. Inconsistent effort. At times he plays hard by cutting, running up the floor, and crashing the boards. But then he’ll disappear—teams will need to do extensive background to gauge his mentality.

He sees everything on the court, creating opportunities for teammates that most players simply don’t see or can’t pull off thanks to his innate ability to manipulate defenders. Excellent ball handler who uses hesitations to put defenders on skates. He uses advanced moves but always remains in control, dictating the pace like a drummer would a song’s tempo. Elite touch. Though he attempts too many floaters and shys away from contact, his ability to score creatively with either hand suggests he could develop into a finisher at the rim. Attentive off-ball player who cuts and adjusts to space well behind the arc. Great rebounder for his position like his older brother Lonzo. His instincts pop up here when tracking down boards. Versatile defender. He’s quick laterally and quite large for a point guard. He has the size to comfortably switch onto wings. MINUSES Ball is a great passer, but he can’t be classified as a great playmaker yet because of his decision-making. He jacks up poor shots early in the clock and settles far too often rather than attacking the rim. Poor shooting mechanics: He has no consistency with his form, other than his low release. As a solid free throw shooter with good touch on floaters, he has obvious upside. But his form—much like his brother’s—must be overhauled. Rarely initiates contact and avoids it around the rim. He doesn’t stay in his defensive stance and often keeps his hands down when closing out—or as Mark Jackson would say: “Hand down, man down.” Defensive discipline: He defaults to switching instead of fighting over screens and he falls out of position off-ball when chasing steals.

At 6-foot-9, he doesn’t have much shake, but he knows how to change speeds with enough aptitude to clear room for his passes. His best role could be as a playmaking hub from the post and on the short roll due to the combination of his height and passing ability.

Excellent team defender who rotates well and typically finds himself in the right position. He’s not an athletic player, but can make an impact with his positioning as a reliable help defender. Good intangibles. He knows how to use his strength: He plays hard and constantly competes. He also takes analytics-friendly shots by mostly scoring on 3s and layups. MINUSES Worrisome shooting: He has solid form but has posted poor percentages from the floor and the line. Off the catch, he tends to pause as he adjusts the ball in his hands. He’s streaky, but he also may just lack touch. Doesn’t have top-end burst or springs, so he’ll really need to master his ball handling to maximize his ability to create space and shots. He’s an active on-ball defender but lacks the lateral quickness to contain quicker players. He works hard, though, and NBA conditioning programs should help.

Strong post-up potential. Displays a rare blend of power and finesse and does a nice job of sealing off his man. But he currently lacks advanced power moves, instead defaulting to fadeaways.

He loves to use hesitations, especially in the pick-and-roll, and he can deliver accurate passes off the dribble. Does the little things like cutting, screening, and rebounding.

Ambidextrous finisher with hops, body control, strength, and touch; he’s much better than his numbers indicate because of North Carolina’s horrific spacing in the half court, often with two nonshooting bigs on the floor. Dynamic ball handler who could thrive with more room as a pick-and-roll threat. He strings together combo moves, showing off a mix of change-of-pace dribbles with crosses using either hand. He looks to score first, but can make basic passes. Dangerous transition threat. He’s an excellent defensive rebounder, and he can provide a jolt by sprinting down the floor on the break. Feisty on-ball defender who has a sturdy frame and excellent lateral movement. Impactful off-ball defender who keeps his head on a swivel and makes timely, fundamental rotations and occasionally flies in for weak-side blocks.

With a speedy first step, he’s easily able to create space for one- or two-dribble pull-up jumpers. Team player who swings the ball. He’s not a primary ball handler, but he understands his role and plays it well. Undersized, but has a 6-foot-10 wingspan that made him into an elite defender in college; in the NBA, he projects as a plus defender, at minimum. Competes on both ends. He rebounds well for a smaller guy and he’ll battle against bigger players. He accepted his role at Kentucky and excelled. MINUSES Poor finisher at the rim; he lacks verticality, an off hand, and a sense for using touch. Lacks playmaking chops; he’s a reactive passer, not a creator.

He flashes behind-the-back moves and Euro-steps, but they often force him to lose control or slow down. If he tightens his handle, it’ll unleash his dribble-drive game.

As wild as the shot is, he has tried it on multiple occasions and at his enormous height it looks proportional to a guard taking a midrange jumper., Skilled post scorer who can hit fadeaways, turnarounds, and hook shots. Defenses currently put smaller defenders on Wemby, and though he can shoot over them, he should also work to add power moves. Then there’d be no scheme that can slow him down and he’d draw constant double teams, activating his playmaking skills., Even if Vic is having an off shooting night, he can offer major value as a sturdy screener and a devastating finisher. He can catch the ball on the short roll and take a few dribbles to get inside, or rise above the defense to throw down thunderous lobs.

If he were on the Bucks, he could play either the Giannis Antetokounmpo role as a help defender or the Brook Lopez role in drop coverages.

Considering his elite size, it is very intriguing that he brings nimble feet, agility, solid leaping ability and long strides making him an extremely promising big man on both ends of the floor … Has potential as a paint “patroller” on defense, and you have to be mindful of his location when heading to the basket or risk a weakside rejection … Has the size, range, and length to be mentioned along the lines of the top young shot-blockers in the NBA … A southpaw, he is at his best, the closer he is to the rim at the moment, and will be able to get his fair share of easy scores by running like a deer in transition for easy baskets, given the speed and athleticism advantage he will enjoy in most matchups … Looks to play above the rim, and seems like a potentially dynamic finisher as a pick/screen and roll player with his soft hands … While his time at Memphis was limited to 69 total minutes of action, teams shot only 33% when Wiseman was on the court, and he made a good amount of eye opening plays altering and blocking shots … Given his length and athletic ability, it seems likely that his defensive ability will translate to the NBA’s “defensive 3 seconds” rule, as he should be able to switch and defend more than adequately outside the paint and on switches as he gets more experience … Pretty good on the glass, especially as an offensive rebounder, and shows a quick 2nd jump … Shows a soft touch around the rim, as well as a developing turnaround jumper and decent jump hook over his right shoulder as the base of his post moves arsenal … The foundation is there for him to make some hay as a mid range shooter, he just needs more repetition, muscle memory and fundamental consistency … Has the frame to carry at least 15 more lbs of muscle without the loss of mobility …","The obvious elephant in the room is that he goes into this draft having played so few minutes of college hoops compared to other 2020 prospects, which makes him a relative unknown in just where he is in his development … While he looked incredibly strong in his first few games, the suspension followed by the decision to shut it down leaves scouts and NBA decision makers with a lot less to work with and the question of just how much his game may have tapered off had he played the entire season … He had a reputation in high school of having a motor that ran hot and cold and there were some questions that many wanted to see answered with a full season of intense play … Wiseman showed glimpses in limited action, but he also showed that he is pretty raw in his skill set and overall basketball IQ at the moment … While he is a potentially game-changing defender, he also seems to be a bit jumpy looking to send shots into the stands, and prone to fakes that lead to fouls or compromises the team’s defensive balance on the court … Whether he can be a true weapon as a scorer at the next level remains in question … He did show decent touch at times with fadaways and mid-range jumpshots … But he remains a real question mark whether he’s a guy that can create legitimate offense for himself  … He’s not very strong or physical right now, will need to put on more weight and get his lower body strength up to bang in the post with the big boys in the NBA … Shot selection can stand to improve, he seems to settle for fade-away shots and jumpers more than you expect for a guy with his physical and athletic traits … His feel for the game seems decent considering his age and development stage, but at times he does appear rushed and mechanical in the low post getting into his moves, and he needs to work on developing his back to the basket game … His ability to defend out on the perimeter is potentially very good for a big guy, but he has some things to learn fundamentally to realize it (ie playing less upright and not relying solely on his length to make up for being out of position) … Doesn’t seem to project to be an elite level shot creator in the post, which means the situation he lands in will matter that much more to his individual success because others will have to create for him, and teach him the nuances of the offensive game …Overall: Wiseman has been a highly discussed prospect dating back to 2017 when he emerged on the high school scene … He is a prospect with some clearly defined strengths that hold value in the current NBA (rim running, defense, rebounding) and some truly special physical attributes … He also has some things he needs to work on (strength, offensive polish, overall basketball IQ) … There is also the fact that he has such limited college hoops film that it makes evaluating his progression as a prospect during the conference slate and NCAA tournament impossible, and those are critical samples when scouting … If he’s in a situation where a team allows him to play off of his teammates spacing on offense, and allows him to patrol the paint and block shots then he will be set up for success … Some teams may want more, particularly if he’s selected in the top 3, but he definitely has the tools to find success and even make an immediate impact

Ball’s shot selection will also need to improve, as he made just enough deep shots to both keep the defense honest, as well as justify (mostly to himself) that he should at times hoist low percentage shots off the dribble from all over the court … While a pretty good athlete, he is more smooth than dynamic and will only sporadically try to play above the rim in the half court … Should continue to add weight and strength to his improving frame, as he currently gets outmuscled by players with similar size on both ends of the court … Has some experience playing off the ball, but clearly is more effective making plays with the ball in his hands … At times can be turnover prone looking to make the home-run play when a simpler play is available … Doesn’t show any real consistent toughness or effort defensively, mostly interested in jumping passing lanes for run outs or trying to swipe for steals … Rarely stays alert or in a stance for full defensive possessions, has issues fighting through screens and may struggle to defend quicker PGs as a young pro … Seems like the type of player who will be asked to defend the other team’s worst perimeter scorer as he develops, but his defensive versatility (and effectiveness) could improve as he gets stronger and shows more awareness, largely due to his physical tools … There have been whispers that some teams may see Ball’s more nonchalant approach as a player as a questionable investment for a potential franchise player and top draft choice, though his improvement over the past few years seems to point to a determined, hard working young player …Overall: LaMelo Ball is a top prospect in the 2020 Draft class and shows truly special natural instincts as an overall playmaker with the ball … There will be a host of teams picking in the top half of the lottery looking for his services, and they will be getting a player who will walk into the NBA with the skill set to put up a triple double statline on any given night…You rarely find guards who have the type of size and talent Ball possesses, though he does have some things to work on in terms of perimeter shooting efficiency and overall defensive presence … Still, his basketball instincts, physical gifts and fun-to-watch style of play will make him a favorite to be selected as the top pick in the draft …Jorrye Nixon 11/9/20Strengths: 6’6 point guard … Good size and length, especially for position … Can shoot off the catch or dribble. Shoots it well from deep and has good arc on shot, most of his makes find the bottom of the net. Hits shots from the NBA 3PT line and is a threat to score from literally anywhere in the half court. His jump shot keeps the defense tense and they must guard him tight away from the basket. Good free throw shooter … Gets to the rim off the dribble, using an effective crossover.

Hits teammates in stride and when they’re in position to score. Can run the pick and roll/pop. Throws accurate outlet passes. Pushes the ball after rebounds, steals, and every other opportunity. Thrives in an up-tempo style but can also play in the half court … Good defender when committed both on and off the ball. Has a nose for the ball, gets clean steals when going for double teams. Good anticipation, jumps passing lanes very well to start instant offense. High steal count … Smooth. Quick hands and light on his feet. Good body control as a ballhandler and in the air.

Sometimes he’s quick with the trigger but never forces his scoring or hunts for his shots. He tends to add points in bunches as needed or they accumulate as the game progresses … Rebounds very well on both ends for position … A triple-double threat in high school and impacts the game in multiple statistical categories … Nonchalant demeanor, doesn’t rattled under pressure … Has a lot of experience competing against grown men. Younger for his class, will turn 18 in August after high school. A full year younger than quite a few players who played in the high school all-star circuits. In one case, two full years younger …Weaknesses: Smooth but not an incredibly explosive athlete.

through considerable adversity to figure out how to utilize his skills and be an NBA contributor … Though his team was decimated with injuries and not really constructed well, he will have to attempt to explain why a typical powerhouse like UNC struggled so much with him there as a ballyhooed recruit, even after he returned after missing a month with a knee injury … Will be 20 years old as an NBA rookie, making him slightly older than most of the Fr in his class …Overall: A highly decorated HS player, and has the kind of natural talent and upside that will be intriguing for teams picking in the lottery … Anthony comes into this draft after productive Freshman season on an extremely disappointing squad … He showed the scoring punch and talent that made him such a highly touted recruit,

guard than a floor general, but in an increasingly position-less NBA, he should still become an essential player given his raw all-around skills and talent, as well as the fact that he has been lauded as a great competitor who has been praised by coaches for his work ethic…Even though UNC had a disappointing season (that was hit hard by injuries, most notably including to Cole Anthony) it was good

"NBADraft.net","Udoka Azubuike",2020,NA,NA,83,260,"Kansas",NA,"Udoka Azubuike’s most obvious strength is pretty hard to miss. He is very big. At 7 feet .25 inches in shoes, and possessing an elite 7’7” wingspan he’s extremely long. Even better, after years in the weight room he’s molded himself into a lean, muscular 260 pound athlete. Dok can hold his own with the biggest and strongest of NBA centers. His size and length give him immediate translatable skills like rebounding and the ability to defend the rim. Azubuike isn’t a stiff either. At the 2020 combine he measured a freakish 37 inch max standing vertical leap, which allowed him to hit the 12’6” mark without any sort of run. After averaging 2.6 blocks per game as a senior at Kansas, Udoka’s size and spring will render him at the very least a plus rim defender in the NBA with the potential to be elite. While not the quickest lateral player his 7’7” wingspan also makes him extremely effective guarding the entire paint area, and extremely effective in one on one post matchups, help and rotational situations in the lane. Even in a more spaced out environment, he would be a major deterrent for offensive players to test their luck in the paint. While not a guy you really want running around by the 3 point line, he’s developed into a solid pick and roll defender too with the ability to effectively switch and stay out of foul trouble. Dok truly was a historic figure in NCAA D1 Hoops. Over four seasons at Kansas he shot .7465% from the field, good for first all time. No, Azubuike isn’t going to impress you with a vast array of post moves, but he is an extremely effective finisher, with the length and girth to be a high level pick and roll target and finisher at the rim at the NBA level. Chances are if he gets the ball in the low post, he’s going to score. Dok upped his rebounding every season at Kansas, and his 10.5 rebounds per game as a senior (3.5 offensive) are good indicators that he’ll be able to collect misses at a good clip at the next level. Over four years he really transformed his body. Dok lost fat, gained muscle and athleticism, and improved endurance which really aided in being in the position to be talked about entering the NBA draft. While not your typical face up big man of 2020, Dok is good enough at what he does (and good enough to be able to do it in the NBA) to be looked at as a potential draft pick or two way player. After seeing how unpolished he was 4 years ago, it’s a testament to his work ethic, which is also another strength","In 1992 we might be talking about a player like Azubuike being picked up in the lottery, but with the way the game has changed, despite being elite as a rebounder, and rim defender, those characteristics don’t hold nearly as much value if you’re not able to stretch the floor for better spacing. No doubt Dok is more comfortable as an offensive player than he was as a freshman, but he’s never really developed the ability to hit a face up jump shot. This makes his only value on offense strictly around the rim. His projected failure to draw his defender away from the hoop will allow defenses to sag off and contend the rim easier. His lack of improvement as a free throw shooter doesn’t exactly paint a trajectory of developing even a consistent 15 footer over the next few years. Udoka shot just 44% from the free throw stripe as a senior, and that was a career high. He is also not a naturally quick lateral defender. His focus on conditioning has certainly allowed him to improve, but guarding face up bigs one on one in the NBA often 20-25 feet away from the basket could make him an easier target to blow past, or exploit by a stretch 5 with three point range.Overall: Udoka Azubuike is an elite shot blocker, defender and finisher with immense size and athletic ability. He’ll be able to protect the rim, finish pick and rolls and dunk anything within 5 feet of the rim at an elite rate. The question is, will that be good enough to stick in the modern game? His low free throw percentages give pause to project much improvement as a shooter, and he could be a hack target late in games with his current woeful free throw ability. Still, Dok could get a shot as a situational backup to plug in lineups when Andre Drummond, Joel Embiid, and other NBA behemoths come to town, and rack up DNPs when matched against fast paced small ball teams. We saw during the 2020 playoffs that sometimes it’s very valuable to have big bodied rim protectors like JaVale McGee and Dwight Howard on your roster in certain situations. Whether it’s in the 2nd round or by way of a rookie free agent contract, I think Udoka will get a shot. It will just be his ability to adapt the NBA game that will eventually mean the difference between sticking or going overseas to earn his check.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Center",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bismack Biyombo",NA,NA,NA,"09/17/99","Lagos, Nigeria",NA,8,6,7,7,"",8,10,8,9,7,7,7,7,43,57,91

"NBADraft.net","Desmond Bane",2020,NA,NA,78,220,"TCU",NA,"Has something very valuable in today’s NBA landscape, and that is high level shooting. As a senior, Bane nailed 42% of his three point attempts, and posted a 3 point percentage over 40% in 3 full NCAA seasons. Bane has excellent range on his jumper, and great in spot up situations as well as shooting off the dribble. He’d be an immediate asset to an NBA team spacing the floor at the two spot. At 6’6” Bane possesses a chiseled frame, and high level strength that will be able to handle the rigors of an NBA season, and larger opponents. His 16.6 points as a senior were primarily earned from the perimeter, but Desmond does have the ability to get into the lane and is very good at using his powerful body to take impact and create distance from opposing shot blockers. Nice touch around the rim, and solid ability to adjust in mid air while getting to the hoop. A smart player who had to become more of a distributor during his senior season. He averaged 3.9 assists per game, and was very good at making the “right” pass, and even showed a little bit of ability to run a pick and roll. At 6’6” he was a very good rebounding guard at the college level hauling in 6.3 boards per contest and even notching 4 double doubles with points and rebounds. Defensively he puts in the work, and while not projected as an elite NBA defender, he could do well in a team scheme. He has active hands and stole the ball 1.5 times per game, and is a good vertical athlete who can contest shots.","While Desmond Bane is tall, strong, and a good vertical athlete he’s not really the total package in terms of physicality. Despite being 6’6” tall, he only has a 6’4.25” wingspan, which makes him one of the few players at this level of basketball to have a wingspan shorter than their height. This limits his defensive potential a bit in the NBA. Again, Bane can get off the ground, but lateral quickness isn’t something that is a strong suit for him. He puts forth tons of effort on the court, which will help him, but when trying to get in the lane off the dribble, or trying to guard a quick player, it’s just going to be harder at the NBA level for someone who’s not naturally quick, or particularly fast at changing directions. Does not really project as an NBA player with a lot of positional versatility. Is likely to play the shooting guard on offense, and guard the shooting guard on defense, with maybe a small portion of small forwards. NBA point guards could likely be too quick for him, and a large portion of small forwards could prove to be too long. I don’t view him as a high upside player, but a guy who can definitely play a role in the NBA for a long time.Overall: Desmond Bane is a high IQ player who plays hard on both sides of the floor, and can knock down the NBA three point shot at a high level. Due to his physical maturity, and high level specialty, he looks like a player who could step in on day one and add spacing and outside scoring to an NBA team. While not the longest or most versatile player, Bane does enough as a ball handler, and passer to add additional value outside of shooting as well. A player in the mix in the middle of the first to the middle of the second, Desmond’s ability to shoot is a hot commodity, and he has the ability to stick in the league as a sharp shooter.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Shooting Guard",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Courtney Lee",NA,NA,NA,"06/25/98","Richmond, IN","Seton Catholic",7,7,7,8,"",7,7,7,9,7,8,8,8,21,36,90

At only 6’8, he will be at a severe disadvantage. He also is not athletically gifted enough to make up for it with leaping ability. His rebounding solely depends on high effort and positioning, which may not be enough at the next level … He is showing promise that he could eventually spread the floor with a perimeter jumper, but until then he will just clog the paint and prevent guards from being able to drive … Tillman is also one of the older players (22 just after the start of the season) in the draft having played three years of college ball at Michigan State … Does not have a great repertoire of post moves and does not threaten too much with a post fadeaway … Jump shooting will make or break Tillman’s career.

Lee took over the Commodores offense with an average of 18.6 points per game as a junior … He is an explosive player who gets to the rim at will and finishes well when he gets there. His slashing ability and playmaking are his greatest strengths as he tries to improve his perimeter shooting game … Lee averaged over four assists per game in his final season and got to the line over six times per game in his final two seasons. He improved from 67% to 75% in these attempts from the line in his final season … He is a fierce defender who averaged at least a steal per game in all three seasons at Vanderbilt. His 6’9 wingspan at only 6’2 is very enticing and combined with his speed and quickness, he looks to be a nightmare to guard on the ball and to go up against as the on-ball defender … Lee shot 55% on two-point shots as a junior showing how great he is around the rim, especially with his massive volume with 13 shots per game … Great ball-handling and quick twitches also make Lee formidable in isolations … Lee is one of the more interesting players in his class because of his long wingspan and great explosiveness. His mix of size and speed will make him a rookie to watch with such a high ceiling.","While Lee has great measurements and athleticism, his jump shot is just as unusual as his long wingspan on a small body. He shot only 33% in his three-year career and his shooting form is very unorthodox. He will certainly be a project and will have to rely on his slashing ability to make up for a lack of a jump shot early on in his career … Lee handled the ball a lot in his final season, but three turnovers per game is also hard to look past. He will have to take better care of the ball at the next level in order to get meaningful minutes … Off-ball defending became an issue a little too often and will have to improve rather quickly in his career … Lee has the quickness, but strength will be a major question mark. He will need to be able to fight through harder screens and go up with taller, stronger defenders on these drives that he was so effective with in college. He could get pushed around much more than he was at Vandy with a short off-season and less time to bulk up with a true, professional workout regimen.Overall: Lee went with the 38th pick in the NBA Draft to the Detroit Pistons and he will join a now crowded backcourt. With experienced guards such as Derrick Rose and Delon Wright headlining the backcourt, and a lottery pick in Killian Hayes also being selected, Lee will have to fight for his minutes and will have to make palpable impacts in these limited minutes. His lack of a perimeter jumper will make this increasingly difficult and stunt his growth as a player.

He improved his three-point shooting from 27% to 43% and averaged over 11 points per game for the Bulldogs … Woodard also improved driving to the basket. He has great bounce and showed it on some powerful dunks. He also uses this bounce effectively to hang in the air longer and maneuver his body around defenders while still in the air. This allows him to have great finishing above and around the rim … He also showed smart and effective movement off the ball allowing him to get some easy buckets at the rim … He positions himself well in the post and gets up for rebounds as he averaged over six per game in 33 minutes per contest … His aggressive defensive playstyle did not lead to many fouls with an average of under two fouls per game … He looked much more comfortable from beyond the arc in his second season and was very effective as a spot up shooter … He also looked sharper with his pull-up jumper and showed potential with his mid-range shooting … Woodard’s best trait is undoubtedly his hustle and his effort. He was the heartbeat of the Bulldogs squad and this high work ethic will allow him to find a spot on a team and work his way up. While he may not be drafted, he will not disappear and will almost certainly get a chance somewhere because of this determination …","Woodard makes up for a lot of his weaknesses with his hard work and hustle but there are still some glaring weaknesses in his game … He is only 6’7 so he needs to have much better ball-handling than he does right now … This poor ball-handling eliminates any possibility for him to be a facilitator or a shot creator. He struggles to get open on his own and he requires a lot of space to make three pointers because of his very slow, Draymond Green-like release. He improved his three-point shooting but it came at a cost as he needs his lower body to squat down and release his shot slowly. He will need to increase the speed of his jumper if he is going to have any success … He will have to play as a rebounding, defending power forward with the potential to spread the floor if he can make his jump shot faster. Again, because of his size this will be a tough transition going up against much larger and stronger NBA forwards … His free-throw shooting is also a cause for concern. He shot only 58% as a freshman and 64% as a sophomore … He is not outstanding in anything that he does, outside of his hustle and effort. He is a very good defender and a good rebounder, but he did not dominate enough in either of these categories in college to suggest that he will do so at the next level.Overall: Woodard is currently not projected to be drafted by NBADraft.net although he is listed as the #51 player on our big board. This is a dramatic climb of 18 spots from the last big board and it is a testament to his high motor and work ethic. In a year dominated by uncertainty, players with high work ethic will be even more touted than ever. You never know how a prospect will turn out, but a player who works hard will always be a good pick, especially if it is late in the draft with little to lose.

Has an intriguing triple threat repertoire, he frequently frees himself up and gets space in the mid-range area by making subtle head and body fakes going in either direction, and has the size and strength to keep defenders on his hip when he gets a step on them … Takes and converts a good amount of step back and sidestep shots off the dribble, showing good ability to lose defenders and get daylight in the mid-range and from deep … Also shows promise as a finisher given his very good strength and body control, has some hesitation and spin moves he goes to if his initial path to the rim is cut off … Effective floater, especially when going right … Above average instincts and basketball acumen, reads the action well on both ends of the court and also does a good job of dictating the flow of the game with the ball in his hands … Came into college with questions about his shooting, and quieted doubters as the year progressed after converting 40% from deep on a robust 5 attempts a game, and he found a variety of ways to make those shots be it spotting up, in transition, off the bounce and occasionally even coming off pin downs … Groundwork is there for him to be a good post-up player when matched up against smaller guards as well, and he is already reasonably effective utilizing spins and hooks over his left shoulder when the defender sits on his strong hand … Projects to be a very good defensive player at the next level, and will offer plenty of versatility as a guy who can potentially switch PG-PF without much drop-off, which holds massive value in today’s NBA … When focused, Cunningham can smother players on the perimeter guarding the ball, beat screens and get back into the play, and also is an asset as a help defender contesting in the paint and/or stepping in for charges … Additionally, he has already shown signs of quick hands and playmaking on this end (1.6 spg & nearly a block per game as a Fr.)…Up to the task in crunch time and when his team needed a scoring boost in general, wants the ball and came up big with the late-game heroics on more than a couple of occasions for OK State as a Fr. with all the eyes on him, which has to be encouraging for his projection as a potential franchise cornerstone … Shot 84% from the FT line (nearly 6 FTA per game), further quieting doubters about his shooting touch while highlighting his hard work into being a shot-making threat … Would not be a surprise to see Cunningham’s overall efficiency rise in the NBA, where there will be less defensive attention placed solely on collapsing on him and more capable shooting options than he enjoyed in his year in Stillwater … Very precocious, mature and confident individual … High character individual with strong family background …","While he is a physically gifted prospect, Cunningham lacks some of the juice in his legs required to be considered a dynamic athlete or leaper … Not the quickest or fastest player either, and it shows at times when he is attacking the rim and/or trying to turn the corner in the pick and roll game offensively in the half court, leading to a number of offensive fouls or wasted possessions that contributed to his high turnover rate and negative A:TO in 2020-2021 (4 topg to 3.5 apg) … Generally makes good decisions against traps and hard hedges, but sometimes forces passes through multiple defenders and had moments when he airmailed passes under pressure as well … Sometimes telegraphs where he wants to go with the ball or drives aimlessly into no mans lands and leaves his feet to make passes, giving help defenders an extra split second to come up with steals and deflections … Just OK as a finisher in traffic, more of a below the rim type player who is likely to try and use his body to shield the ball and finish around the defense rather than elevating and finishing with authority amongst the trees in half court offense … Smaller guards can get low and pester him into turnovers when he gets lax with his handle initiating offense, will need to get somewhat more refined and aware as a ball-handler at the lead guard spot … Can be beat off the dribble by slashers occasionally, possesses only adequate lateral quickness and sometimes gets upright when denying penetration; subsequently picking up fouls (2.5 per game) or collapsing the team’s defense … His footwork could stand to improve at times as well, occasionally makes wild closeouts or takes wasted steps that can be attacked off the bounce or turned into FTs by players who are savvy about drawing fouls …Overall: Cunningham has all the makings of the #1 overall pick in the 2021 Draft, and has been widely projected as such since he decided to honor his commitment to OK State just before the start of the 2020 season … He showed a very strong all-around game as a Fr., and his projection to the NBA is centered around his size and frame, ability to be a playmaker for himself and others, promise as a position less defender, his emergence as a knockdown shooter, and as someone you can rely on to take and make a shot in the clutch all in one … He routinely made big plays down the stretch for an OK State team that really struggled to shoot the ball but played its best basketball in March largely due to their young blue chip recruit…He has some athletic limitations and some fundamental chinks in his armor to work on as a ball-handler and playmaker while he continues to polish his guard skills, but he has already shown that he is willing to work and improve by the strides he made in a year as a shooter for there to be little to worry about going forward … benefits from today’s game where, ‘high usage’, “ball dominant” players that are in his mold like Luka Doncic and Jayson Tatum are dominating the league …Jorrye Nixon 5/3/21Strengths: 6’6 combo guard … Good size and length, especially for position with a 7’0.25 wingspan … Good athlete, gets to the rim and finishes above the rim with ease.

well-rounded scoring threat, but until his shot creating and jumper get more consistent he could be categorized as a “Jack of all trades, master of none” type … Prefers to step back and side step to create space for shots as opposed to getting north and south as a ball-handler, which can limit the pressure he puts on the heart of the defense while also limiting how often he gets to the foul line

Uses a good mix of head fakes and ball handling moves to manipulate defenders. Routinely extends plays by continuing to attack defenders to force help side rotations, allowing for his teammates to find openings. Excellent at step back jumpers, especially off the pick and roll – creates a lot of space on his step backs. If defenders stay with his step back, he’s often able to drive to the rim and finish. Always has his eyes up when driving, allowing him to find cutting teammates for easy baskets when the defense helps. Mixes long strides and short choppy steps to create angles to attack.

Lacks length with just a 6’4 wingspan …  Has a thin frame that needs to put on muscle at the next level. Passes aren’t always the most accurate – passes don’t always hit teammates in the shooting pocket. This can force teammates to take more difficult shots from time to time. Has a narrow base on his jump shots which projects better for shooting off the bounce as opposed to catch and shoot. Narrow shot base can make it easier for him to be off balance while elevating on his shot. Doesn’t get ideal elevation on his shot, which can lead to easier contests. Can try to do too much, resulting in turnovers. Over-dribbles when met with pressure. Showed a poor second effort at times defensively. Florida’s defense liked to switch 1-4 on ball screens, Mann will have to get used to fighting through/around screens more often. Allows his center of gravity to get too high while defending and can find himself getting beaten by quick guards as a result.Outlook: Mann is a skilled scorer and creator with the ball in his hands. He knows how to manipulate defenders and get to his spots on the court. However, he plays much smaller than he is, so even at 6’5”, he’s a one position player as he plays closer to 6’1”. His ability to create his own looks in the pick and roll and find ctters should translate very well to the NBA and he can make an impact right away.

from 15-18 ft or sidestep gather jumpers from 3 ala James Harden … Not afraid to take heavily contested jumpers, and shows plenty of promise in doing so (especially from mid-range) because of his shot-making ability, high shot release and wiry strength to finish through contact … Has a floater in his mid-range bag as well … Good open court player, will run the floor looking for spot up 3s or slash to the rim in transition and be opportunistic after turnovers … Has a good feel for attacking closeouts and a nice 1st step, can stick a 1 or 2 dribble pull up almost in his sleep if the defender runs him off the 3-point line … No problem getting to the foul line and makes few mistakes when there (7.6 FTA per game on 88%), has already began to master the ability of using the defenders aggressiveness against them by getting them to bite on his pump fakes or seeking contact on the way to the rim … Came in and was one of the most productive scorers in all of college hoops, and did so

wired to score and doesn’t really contribute much in any other areas of the game … Though he seems to have decent length, his physical and athletic profiles are average at best for the backcourt

bounce … Saw a good number of his shots near the rim get blocked as a Fr., doesn’t really play above the rim much even with a head of steam … Will never be confused for a floor general on the court, and though he will inevitably be asked to defend both guard spots, it is difficult to project him to be a combo guard offensively (1.4 apg) … Has a floater in his arsenal, but its inconsistent at the moment … Forces a large amount of low percentage, contested shots as a player who uses his jumper as his main tool to score (40% from the field, 32% from 3), shot selection needs improvement and would go a long way to making his offensive efficiency rise…Pretty streaky 3-point shooter, was no stranger to slumps during the conference schedule … Doesn’t pass much, when he gets the ball he usually is looking to let it fly and some may consider him to be a “black hole” offensively … Not a devoted defensive player, does little to make things difficult for whoever he guards and rarely will fight to get back in plays after getting caught in a screen or beat off the dribble … Even though he was the top scorer on his team, he was generally 2nd or 3rd in the pecking order as the players who were asked to take late shots for LSU in the clutch this past year …Overall: Thomas is a prolific scoring guard and really had some big games throughout his Fr. season, lighting up the scoreboard on a very experienced and talented LSU team … Played well in the NCAA Tournament, and tied Zion Williamson and Kevin Durant for most points for a Fr. through their 2 tournament games (57) … Was a highly regarded recruit in VA and seemed to use being a notable McDonalds All-American game snub as motivation to show that he’s one of the best amateur players around…To get an idea of just how special he is at getting buckets, he is the all-time leading scorer in Oak Hill Academy’s storied history, a school that has an alumni full of HS basketball royalty … He’s a fun player to watch and a pretty smooth operator who makes scoring in chunks look easy at times as he hit shots from all over the court … Still he needs to keep working on his 3-point shooting eye, even though his range and touch are both high level, and pick his shots better to maximize his ability as a scorer … He’s not the most physically gifted prospect and is considered to be a one trick pony, and some even think he plays a selfish brand of basketball, but you can’t argue with or ignore the type of production and success he’s seen with his playing style … Whether he starts or is brought off the bench, you know he will be able to put points on the board and that will make him a relatively high floor prospect in 2021 class …",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Shooting

an aggressive, confident mindset that bodes well looking at his potential on both ends at the NBA level…Nice transition player who is tough to contain when he has a head of steam on his way to the basket, being effective at both creating contact to draw fouls (over 6 FT a game on a solid 79% as a Soph.) and using his excellent body control to create space for driving lanes…Promising ability to post up smaller guards, is stronger than his size suggests and is skilled at using his shoulders to create space for turnaround jumpers…Looks good operating at the mid-range level, and is most confident as a shooter from about 15-18 ft…Pretty solid pull up jumper from the mid range…Is a factor in the dribble handoff & pick and roll game too, showing a nice rhythm pulling up off of 2 dribbles…Developing range and shotmaking ability, occasionally made defenders pay as a spot up shooter in the relatively few possessions he played off the ball..Put points on the board in a hurry (19 ppg) often for a team that played at a slow pace all season, and his emergence as a breakthrough player (over 12 ppg and 10 mpg increase from Fr to Soph season) is most impressive because of the amount of defensive attention he received as the year progressed…Projects to become a tough defender as well, where his competitive nature, solid fundamentals, and quick feet make him a nuisance on the ball currently…Impressed many college hoop observers with his willingness to guard the other teams best offensive wings regularly, even though he shouldered so much of an offensive load…Has enough of the twitchy athleticism and instincts needed to be a threat in the passing lanes (1.1 spg for his career), while also having quick reactions when contesting shots and recovering from getting around screens…Reads action instinctively and often diagnoses set plays before they unfold to force turnovers or bad shots…His nose for the ball and aggressiveness also shows itself on the boards, where Davis ranks among the very best in this class regardless of position statistically (8.2 rpg)…Somewhat of a late bloomer who has garnered experience both as a role player and go-to guy early in his prospect development, could be able to hang his hat in some playing roles that would allow him to contribute to an NBA rotation sooner than later while he refines other areas of his game…His massive improvements from his Fr to Soph season show that he is a hard-working player, while his ability to fight through late season injuries to help Wisconsin in conference and NCAA tourny games show his

well to the primary ball handler role he so often played in college…Shot selection needs to improve (42% FG), he has some struggles getting into the paint against athletic defenders and with finishing at the rim amongst the trees once there, which leads him to try numerous heavily contested shots off the bounce with mixed results (just 46% FG from inside the arc in his career)…Some will point to his late season ankle injury for his explosiveness and efficiency tailing off, and while it did contribute to it, he hasn’t really posted more than average production finishing at the basket even when fully healthy…More rangy than sudden as a slasher, relies more on angles and off balanced defenders to create separation than ball-handling or quickness…At times Davis dribbles too much when creating and is somewhat predictable with his moves, as teams started to successfully anticipate his stepback jumper more and more as the season went along…Can sometimes play into high IQ defenders hands by being overly physical when creating offense, and gets called for fouls using his off arm to create space at times…Had occasional good moments as a 3-point shooter off the dribble, and while his shot isn’t broken he was not an efficient shooter from beyond the arc as a Soph (30% 3FG) and endured a long shooting slump from deep through the last 2 months of the season…Has an average release speed on his shot that makes him project better as an off-ball set shooter from deep, and though he has been solid at it in his career (ex. he shot 38% 3FG on limited attempts as a Fr) he hasnt really been given many chances to show it due to being mostly an on-ball player…Will likely have to use his defense, athleticism and hustle to earn rotational minutes in the early stages of his career while he polishes his offensive skills and learns certain nuances of the game (ie picking his spots and playing to his strengths offensively)Overall: Johnny Davis’ ascension from a bench player as a Fr to a consensus All American contributor as a Soph has him solidified as a high 1st round prospect currently…After winning a gold medal last summer in the FIBA U19 games, Davis used the momentum from that experience to get off to a scorching hot start to the 2021-2022 season that saw him raise his draft stock into Top 5 discussion in the first months of the season after lukewarm discussion about him as a 2022 prospect prior…He became by far the go-to guy offensively on a defensive-minded, methodical Wisconsin squad and put the team on his back & the college hoops world on notice with some huge performances, most notably in a win against 3rd ranked Purdue where Davis had 37 pts and 14 rebs and often matched up against; and got the better of, fellow projected 2022 lottery pick guard Jaden Ivey…Davis is a player with a football background, and it shows in his physical, aggressive nature on the court as well as his willingness to play through nagging injuries…He really competes and his increased production and role shows that he’s willing to work hard…His role at the next level projects to be different than in college, as he seems likely to play more off the ball as a wing at the next level and not as a true primary or secondary playmaker for himself and others…His potential as a prospect is largely tied to his ability to improve his consistency and range as a shooter and working on his shot selection…He seemed to wear down somewhat at the end of this past season due to a combination of injuries, big minutes and true 2-way responsibilities as the main scorer and best defensive player on his team…He could very well improve his efficiency and effectiveness with less of a burden to carry and more talented teammates in the future, and he has the toughness and intangibles to find a niche as a role player until his other offensive skills get more refined …Jorrye Nixon 5/5/22Strengths: Shooting guard with solid all around skill and understanding … Davis is capable of driving to the basket with either hand and finishes well around the rim with both hands … Crafty slasher who is deadly in the midrange and showcases a variety of post-scoring moves … Excellent shooter from all three levels with a 44/34/86 shooting split through ten games of his sophomore season … One of, if not the most, improved players in all of college basketball … Averaging 21 points per game for Wisconsin after averaging only 7 as a freshman … Outstanding intangibles and leadership skills … Big shot maker who never backs down from big moments … Great rebounding guard who averages more than 6 boards per game … Improving as a playmaker and passer every game and does a good job limiting turnovers despite his high usage rate (2.3 AST, 1.9 TO) … 34% three-point shooter with four attempts per game. Can knock down threes off the dribble or spotting up, but mostly creates for himself as the primary ball-handler without playmaking guards around him … Can flourish in any role, but his development as a star this year is putting him into lottery discussion … Physical, aggressive defender who can guard 1-4 and disrupt passing lanes off the ball. Currently averaging 1.6 steals per game which is fourth in the Big Ten … Easy to notice his long arms with his disruption and ability to alter and block shots as a guard with nearly a block per game … Moves very well laterally defensively to stay in front of defenders and avoid foul trouble. His fouls per 40 minutes are down from 3.5 to 1.6 this season … Could flourish as a 3-and-D guard early in his career before embracing his current role as a shot-creator with more development and bulkier frame … High potential player who is just starting to scratch the surface of his skill set …Weaknesses: Lacks ideal size at 6’5 for a shooting guard, but we’ve seen more players with this size find success in the league in recent years … Doesn’t always create a lot of space for himself on jumpers, but gets away with making contested jumpers against smaller defenders … Solid athlete with good wingspan, however … Doesn’t always appear to create separation against top level athletes. Speed remains one of his biggest question marks … Lacks elite level lateral speed … Needs to continue to improve as a playmaker and not just as a scorer off the dribble … Good, but not great athleticism, which raises concerns again about creating space for himself and also guarding top-level NBA guards …  A/TO ratio is just 1-1, so he can stand to improve his passing, ball handling and decision making to become a more well rounded shooting guard …Outlook: Recently emerged as a top player in the nation, which could be a simple hot streak that could fizzle out or a true indication of his development this summer … Though the first half of the season is on pace to be a lottery pick …",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Shooting Guard",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kentavious Caldwell-Pope",NA,NA,NA,"02/27/02","LaCrosse, WI","Central",8,7,8,NA,"",8,8,7,8,8,8,8,7,10,8,93

Duren has been known to throw down some ferocious dunks & he has the type of hands and wide catch radius needed to snag errant passes or rebounds out of his area … Potential in screen and roll action is intriguing to teams … Generally does a good job of keeping the ball/his hands high when he catches it, wastes little motion when catching and finishing … Runs the floor extremely well, especially after turnovers/blocked shot possessions, and should be rewarded often for it if matched with unselfish facilitator(s)…Already pretty strong for a young C prospect, and has the frame to add more muscle without loss of mobility…Not afraid to play through contact as a finisher and rebounder, and uses his strength well to defend the post…Potentially more than just a catch-and-finish big man, has a developing feel for the game and passing skills when facing up…Made a few good decisions when making reads in the mid post to find cutters this past season that are reason for intrigue…Likes to sporadically use a right handed jump hook in the paint when he can’t simply catch and finish…Likely would be the youngest prospect selected in the 2022 Draft after reclassifying to the 2021 HS class (wont turn 19 years old until the beginning the next NBA season) could likely just be scatching the surface …","Motivation level is one of the key Duren is a major work in progress offensively, especially in terms of low post skill level…Has virtually no back to the basket game at the current stage, and heavily relies on lobs, rim runs and offensive rebounds to do the majority of his scoring..Loses effectiveness and tends to disappear the slower the pace of the game is currently…Fundamentals and footwork are behind his physical ability and athleticism; pre-determines what he wants to do when he has the ball and struggles when he has to improvise, leading to some awkward possessions…Shows a middling basketball IQ…Shaky touch around the rim and as a short range shooter, and tends to take fadeaways more than someone with his tools should right now…FT shooting needs improvement (62 FT%), not someone who would be trusted on the floor in a late game situation…Can become foul prone when matched with more savvy bigs defensively (2.7 FPG), but also runs into trouble setting his feet which leads to moving screen fouls at times…A bit overzealous at times trying to protect the rim, can get himself out of position or bite on pump fakes trying to block shots..Occasionally gets beat off the dribble on perimeter switches when he’s caught playing too upright and relaxing his stance…Has the makings of a defensive stalwart, but definitely needs polish and more coaching to reach his full potential …Overall: Duren had a solid, productive Fr. season after arriving at Memphis as a blue chip recruit from Montverde Academy, and was a big reason the Tigers made their 1st return to the NCAA Tournament since 2014 and advanced to the Rd of 32 before bowing out in a hard fought game against Gonzaga … He has been lauded for his size and run-jump athleticism since his HS days, and it was on full display this season … His defensive presence led to Memphis being one of the best teams in the country on that side of the ball this past season, especially in terms of shot-blocking, and he seemed to adjust to the college game slowly but surely as the season went along and, in no coincidence, so did the Memphis team and coaching staff as a whole … He is not quite the sum of his parts yet; his on-court instincts, fundamentals and overall skill level on both ends all need work, but he fared admirably well for a raw 18 year old big man who was expected to be a 2023 draft class prospect (was a dark horse projection for the 1st pick in that class) until shortly before reclassification not long before this past season … He has some gifts that can’t be taught, and in a class that doesn’t have many highly projected true big men, he stands out as the most intriguing and currently is a projected lottery pick who should test well at pre-draft workouts…Duren could be a great find for the right team who focuses on his development correctly and lines him up with more unselfish-type facilitators than he played with at the college level … If he lands in the right situation at the next level, a team could look to mold him into a Bam Adebayo type of versatile center …Jorrye Nixon 4/21/22Strengths: 6’10 big man … Great length with a 7’5 wingspan and big hands … Very good mobility … Explosive athlete, gets up quick and effortless.

played hero ball (out of necessity at times) and missed open teammates routinely when slashing…Was a bit of a “feast or famine” type player from game to game this past season, and many noticed that he generally struggled mightily with his efficiency when he played against the quality teams on Nebraska’s schedule…Doesn’t have the quickest or highest release at the moment, though his size allows him some leeway shooting over closeouts…Would have to greatly increase his shooting efficiency at the next level (27% 3FG) to justify some of the shots he takes…Feel for the game and overall awareness on the court are a work in progress…Tends to easily get bottled up by physical players, can be forced into stagnant possessions and turnovers when defenders pressure him with the ball…Gets pushed around and washed out of plays defensively right now, showing minimal interest fighting through contact on that side of the floor…A poor defender on a bad defensive team in college, had all kinds of issues containing dribble penetration and backdoor plays alike…Often does himself little favors with his underwhelming fundamentals and activity level on that end; doesn’t get into a stance consistently and the high center of gravity he plays with is an issue when he has to defend quick perimeter players in space…More foul prone than your usual guard prospect (2 fouls per game as a Fr.), gets handsy and starts reaching when he gets beat off the bounce…Can be a phantom on the court when he has an off shooting night, often doesnt contribute much outside of scoring currentlyOverall: McGowens was a blue chip level HS recruit who decomitted from Florida State to join Fred Hoiberg and Nebraska;

He’s already attempted 62 free throws for the Cornhuskers and his high percentage of 84% at the line is encouraging for his eventual development as a perimeter shooter … Extremely high upside player … Smart player with high basketball IQ should carve out a major role for himself at the next level … Excellent rebounder due to impressive vertical and athleticism …Weaknesses: His three-point averages are down as a freshman, but with the high volume of threes and good free-throw percentage, we could easily see that improve … Struggles against high motor defenders, turning the ball over far too often for his number of assists (1.9 TO/1.8 AST) … Must improve upon his shot selection, partiiularly three point shots as he often settles for rushed shots when defenders are too near him … Defensive energy and engagement is inconsistent at this point and will require more attention in order to become a solid defender at the next level … Efficiency needs improvement with high point totals being more attributed to volume than productive efficiency … Still needs a little more time to develop.

made defenders pay numerous times with good kick out passes to open teammates when the defense collapsed on him in the post … Plays with a high motor and a solid base; is a tough player who will seek out contact … Got to the foul line at a good rate the past 2 seasons and is solid for his position when there (about 75% FT on over 6 FT/A per game the past 2 seasons) … Also showed improved conditioning as a Jr., playing nearly 5 more mpg than the previous season and visibly adding more mobility and quickness after slimming down … Shedding weight had a direct correlation to his increased shot-blocking production (from 1 BPG his 1st 2 seasons to over 2.5 BPG this past season), as he factored much more swatting shots in help side defense and on the move this year than just walling up at the point of attack like previous seasons … Likes to use right hand floaters and jump hooks from the 10 ft area … Often played as a C by necessity at Ohio State throughout his career, and could potentially steal minutes in a small lineup at that spot in the NBA … Made nice strides in his spot-up & pick-and-pop perimeter shooting over his career after starting as mostly a back-to-basket low post player (went from below 20% as a Fr. to an my above average 37% on nearly 4 attempts a game from deep as a Jr.), which has been a welcoming sight for NBA teams … Solid rebounder in his area (7.9 RPG as a Jr.) … An overachiever type who gets the most out of himself;

and he still needs to refine and polish his scoring arsenal at all 3 levels a bit more from a fundamental standpoint, but it’s hard to not like the motor … It’s worth noting that his lack of height is alleviated somewhat by the floor spacing and smaller lineups NBA teams frequently use too, and isnt as much of a glaring weakness at it had been before…Still, he projects favorably to being a frontcourt role player and could be a factor in a teams rotation in the mold of Marcus Morris type if he lands in the right situation…He’s projected as a late 1st round pick and has boosted his stock and improved on the main areas that the draft advisory spoke to him about polishing up in his NBA Combine debut after his Soph. season last summerNotes: Measured 6’5.5” barefoot, 6’7.0” in shoes 8’10.0” standing reach, 242.8 lbs, and 6’11.75” wingspan at the 2021 NBA Draft Combine …Jorrye Nixon 4/24/22",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Power Forward",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Eric Paschell",NA,NA,NA,"12/18/00","Belleville, IL","Belleville West",6,8,8,NA,"",7,8,8,7,8,7,8,8,31,32,90

his offensive profile would be really nicely rounded out with the threat of a deep ball … Doesn’t draw contact as much as he should given his size (only 2.4 FTA/G), can fall in love with the mid-range too much and bail out defenders at times … Has quick hands but didn’t force many turnovers in college (0.8 SPG), and is better defending on the ball than off at the moment …Overall: Jalen Hood-Schifino is a prospect who established himself as a consensus 5-star recruit during his Jr and Sr seasons at national powerhouse Montverde Academy, where he won 2 HS national titles and played in the Jordan Brand Classic … He joined Indiana as their highest rated signee since 2018 and was largely seen as the preseason favorite to be the Big 10 Freshman of the Year (which he did win at the end of the season) and largely lived up to the hype, helping lead Indiana to a Round of 32 finish…He started the season sharing ball-handling responsibilities but became the teams main ball-handler after an injury to their upperclassman starting PG Xavier Johnson, ultimately forming a blossoming connection and dynamic duo with All-American and fellow 2023 Draft prospect Trayce Jackson-Davis that was among the strongest 1-2 punches in the NCAA this past season…He also had some big moments this season, particularly his memorable 35-point, 6 3-pointer outburst in a win @ then-1st ranked Purdue in late February … Hood-Schifino’s pick and roll prowess with Jackson-Davis offered nice glimpses of his potential NBA role as a strong-bodied 6’6 slasher who used the threat of his big to torch teams in the mid-range area with his picture-esque pull-up J and instinctive passing ability on the move … He also was well-equipped to handle defensive responsibilities in the physical Big 10 as a Fr. and had some outstanding moments as an on-ball defender that project well to the pros … His lack athleticism does to a degree lower his upside, and he will need to continue to improve his shooting range, particularly with his feet set, to round out his offensive game and realize his potential versatility to play multiples spots along the perimeter offensively and not always have to operate with the ball in his hands, even though that’s when he’s clearly at his best … Still, Hood-Schifino’s game is really promising, as is his competitive nature, and he has a ton of traits & skills that translate well to NBA basketball today as a PG/SG … Look for him to be selected in the 1st round of the 2023 Draft, with a pretty good chance to be snagged in the lottery …",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Point Guard/Shooting Guard",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Malcolm Brogdon",NA,NA,NA,"06/19/03","Pittsburgh, PA","Montverde Academy",7,8,8,NA,"",9,8,8,6,8,7,8,8,16,14,92

Loves physical drives where he gets a half step past his defender, gets the shoulder into him, and holds position. From there he will often go into a spin move and silky smooth righty finish at the hoop … Determination. An engaged and aggressive defender with a fantastic motor … Dribbles very powerfully, really slams the ball on the ground making it difficult to steal, with control … He’s incredibly strong, especially when guarded by a two or three, and he really loves that little base line or mid range jumper … He tends to look a little out of control on the drive, especially in the full court. But the result is pure, he usually gets to his spot and can finish with a nice righty scoop lay up or jump stop into a floater … Especially if he can squeeze an extra few inches out of his shooting range and become proficient at least from the corner threes, it will likely make a big difference for his effectiveness at the next level … Insofar as you trust the stat in this context, his defensive rating remained around 89, which is very good. His UCLA teammate, and National Defensive Player of the Year Jaylen Clark had a defensive rating of 86 (which is elite). The question becomes to what extent did Jaquez benefit from playing with another elite defender, and within a great system, vs what his individual contribution and abilities are? All that said, he appears to have many skills, such as good hands and good instincts, that can help on the defensive end. His teammate Clark got a mind blowing 3.4 steals per game. But Jaquez was no slouch – second on the team with a still damn-good 1.9, a testament to his hands and instincts … Decent free throw percentage at just below 80%… it’s surprising he didn’t get there more often given his very physical style of play (less than 4 FTA per game) … Really turned into an elite rebounder his senior year at more than 8 per game total, and 2.5 offensive rebounds per game, a marked improvement over previous seasons …","Fast enough in a straight line.

There were a number of times we saw him get beat in an isolation situation off the dribble by a quicker ballhandler … There are many ways to mask and hide this in the NBA, but of course worth noting … At UCLA he had an anomalous nearly 40% 3P sophomore shooting season. But mostly he was only about 31% from three in his time at UCLA — not good enough for the next level… You’d love to see him rely a little less on the faraway, which can be a hard to shot to maintain consistency with, and instead establish position and go up with a simpler form … If he can maintain consistency in the fadeaway, then by all means, through … 8.3.5″ standing reach is on the small side for a combo forward … Turned 22 in February (16th) making him one of the older players, though what you would expect as a senior …Overall: A throwback. Strong, physical forward with a face up game. Has a reputation for being a bit slow-footed especially defensively, which is fair. And he rarely get more than 3-4″ off the floor. But there is a whole lot to like, even defensively, including his excellent hands and instincts and his 6’9.5″ wingspan in 6’7” frame… Can an NBA defensive scheme cover up his slower feet? Yes, and he’s capable of making it worth their while on the offensive end… Anyone who plays in the school yard knows “the old man’s game” and Jaquez has a lot of that. Smarts, craftiness, good hands, physicality, soft touch, and a very powerful spin move / drop step. Would love to see him bump up his 3P percentage, as she’s shown flashes of being capable of. Stylistically, he stands out in a few ways. Stylistically, the way he runs, it’s sort of like these short, choppy steps (but he has decent speed in a straight line).

seemingly has missed shots that are tipped or rimmed out fall into his lap every game … Enjoying a breakout season as a Jr. after being a per-minute savant as the teams 6th man during his Soph. season, and has seen his scoring totals double with more playing time (9.7 to 20.4 ppg, both on 48 FG%) … A career 35 3FG% that has 3-level scoring ability, and possesses a soft touch with consistent mechanics … Has the size to shoot over most wings with ease…Is a versatile mismatch threat with his offensive package and has played minutes everywhere from SF-C in Iowa’s spaced out scheme … Shows above average footwork and quickness around the rim and does a nice job utilizing up-and-unders and occasional spin moves to create space for himself (shooting 59% inside the arc as a Jr.) … Nice floater and 1-2 dribble pull up when chased off the line … Has especially enjoyed major success off the bounce facing up the big guys in the Big 10, who are notoriously lumbering, by getting them to respect his jumper and forcing them to defend him away from the basket … Not selfish; looks to initiate transition opportunities after rebounds and is comfortable handling and dishing in the open court … Runs the floor and can finish above the rim in the open court … Continues to steadily improve as a defender;

is known for his prolific shooting numbers (career 39 3FG%, 356 made 3s in his career) and he lit teams up from downtown and in the mid-range throughout his time in college … A knockdown shooter with a quick, high release when he has his feet set and he does a good job of moving to open spots and taking whatever the defense gives him … Good in transition, off DHOs and with rhythm pull-ups too, and shows enough savvy & subtle body control to lean in or fade away and create some room to get shots off even when guarded by quicker defenders at times…Nice mid-range game … Has solid footwork and always seems to have his legs underneath him, wasting little motion getting where he needs to on the court … A tricky and unorthodox player; uses the threat of his jumper to manipulate the defense’s attention expertly, particularly in ball screen situations, and is arguably as effective a passer on the move as he is a shooter (4 APG as a Sr.)…Played extended time as a PG early in his career and makes quick decisions; with his sound timing and vision he is often a step ahead of the competition in reading what’s happening on the court…Doesn’t need to dominate the ball or stagnate possessions to produce, which bodes well for him at the pro level … Plays at his own pace and rhythm;

will likely be targeted often in switches and have to be either hidden or in a highly disciplined scheme to mask his athletic deficiencies on this end … Even on possessions when he was in the right spots teams often scored over and around him, particularly near the rim where he is able to offer minimal resistance…Hard to see him forcing many turnovers at the next level, as he takes a pretty conservative approach to defending by trying to always be in position and not having to worry about recovering much…Upside questions;

You’d love to see him develop as a knockdown outside shooter and/or monster defender like a Gary Payton II … Did not have a productive season and enters the draft after his freshman year boosted by “being who he is” — the son of LeBron James. He is an NBA caliber athlete, but a bit undersized, and he did not prove himself in his lone season at USC … There were plenty of issues outside his hands during the season, but the truth remains that he was not a productive player this past season …Outlook: Bronny had a scary incident just prior to his freshman season at USC in which he suffered a cardiac arrest at a practice. Details were understandably kept somewhat sparse. But the good news is that he appears to have made a full recovery. He suited up for USC for the 2023-24 (albeit well after the season started), which was very much up in the air when the news was first reported. Bronny selected USC in what was one of the highest profile college recruitments of recent memory… Bronny made a huge leap in his development, going from top-50 to top-25 in his class from junior to senior year (high school) … Was selected for, and then showed out in the McDonald’s All American game, finishing with 15 points on 5-8 from 3P range … Undoubtedly was using the game to show off his improved outside shooting … Also finished second in the McDonald’s All American Dunk Contest … Played well at the Nike Hoop Summit, finishing with 11 points and playing a key role in sparking a 4th quarter run that ultimately put Team USA over the top against the World Team in the 6 point win…",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Shooting Guard",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jeremy Pargo",NA,NA,NA,"10/06/04","Los Angeles, CA","Sierra Canyon",8,7,7,NA,"",7,7,8,8,8,7,6,7,56,47,88

Him sitting out was seemingly a big deal for a Jayhawk team that was lacking depth this past season, and they sputtered to end the season…McCullar was clearly a valuable player to them as their top perimeter scoring threat, defensive stopper and his emergence as a playmaker they ran plenty of offense through … He was beginning to establish himself firmly as a lock to be drafted, even projected at early points of the season to be as high as a mid 1st round pick potentially…His perimeter defense and toughness will be his main selling point as a pro prospect, and teams will also be interested to see if they can build on his improvement shooting from distance, which would make him more easily appealing as a 3-and-D wing…He’s older, has dealt with multiple lower extremity injuries and has some limitations to his game that plateau his upside, but McCullar could hear his name called in the 2024 Draft given his college pedigree and the clear value he has as a potential stopper … Best case he develops into a player in the mold of a Malcolm Brogdon / Josh Hart …",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Shooting Guard",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Justin Anderson",NA,NA,NA,"03/15/01","San Antonio, TX","Karen Wagner",6,7,7,NA,"",8,8,8,7,8,7,8,7,43,50,88
