ESPN,Jack Hughes,2019,NA,NA,,18,USA U18,NTDP,"Hughes has such great burst and an effortless glide in his skating, and he uses his edges to create separation. He sees the ice and processes play development at an elite level. Hughes is an expert at making plays in small areas, which is why his size is less of a bother. Although he definitely needs to continue adding muscle, Hughes is unafraid to go to the hard areas of the ice and protects himself well, thanks to his skating and anticipation skills. He takes care of his own end and uses those anticipation skills to cut down passing lanes, but his defense needs improvement. I have yet to watch a game in which he didn't drive play, shift in and shift out. -- Peters Team fit: Hughes gives the Devils two young centers around whom to build. He joins 20-year-old Nico Hischier, taken first overall in 2017, to form a formidable one-two punch. His arrival gives the franchise some clear direction, which will be vital if the Devils are to re-sign 2018 Hart Trophy winner Taylor Hall before next summer's unrestricted free agency. -- Wyshynski",,NHL (Devils),NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Kaapo Kakko,2019,NA,NA,,18,TPS,Finland,"Kakko has a great frame and uses it well, as he's hard to take off the puck and uses that ability to create extra time for himself. He has the vision to spot plays and make them quickly, and I think his hand skills have gotten to a fringe elite level. His shot is high-end and heavy; he can beat goalies from distance, but then he also has the skill to make plays in tight at the net front. Although not Hughes-like in his skating, he is powerful and has enough speed to break away from the opposition. His edgework is strong, and his balance makes him so difficult to play against. Kakko battles as well as any player, both in puck pursuit and with it on his stick. There's a definite fire in him to compete, and he will be a cornerstone NHL winger. -- Peters Team fit: After his performances in Liiga, the pro league in Finland, and the IIHF world championships, anticipation is high that Kakko will make an immediate impact for the Rangers as a goal-scoring winger. The Rangers are in a multiyear rebuild and have amassed a good number of young offensive players. With prospects like Lias Andersson and Filip Chytil at center, Kakko should fit in nicely. -- Wyshynski",,NHL (Rangers),NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Kirby Dach,2019,NA,NA,,18,Saskatoon,WHL,"Dach has size, smarts and skill. It's not often that you get a play-driving center at 6-foot-4 who makes the game look as easy as Dach does. Although he lacks explosiveness, he skates smoothly and has a great sense of how to get to where he needs to be efficiently. When he does have the puck, Dach is a shot-pass threat who can score goals in a variety of ways. He's especially successful at driving the net. He can also pick teams apart from the outside, thanks to high-end vision and elite distribution skills. He has dealt with bouts of inconsistency, but when he is on, he is unstoppable. -- Peters Team fit: The Blackhawks have a surplus of top defensive prospects (not a bad problem to have), so it wasn't necessarily a surprise they bypassed Bowen Byram. They get a center in Dach, which is a huge area of organizational need. Chicago needed any forward, really. Out of the non-Jack Hughes centers in this draft, Dach is the most likely to crack an NHL roster next season, though it would be a surprise to see him in Chicago in 2019-20. -- Kaplan",,WHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Bowen Byram,2019,NA,NA,,18,Vancouver,WHL,"There is no denying that he has some incredible offensive skill, but I would like to see Byram become a bit more consistent as a defender. I think the skating is excellent, and he has a good sense of how to play efficiently in a boatload of minutes. One scout I spoke to expressed concern that the way Byram scored goals -- popping deep into zones and aggressively jumping plays -- won't translate to the NHL. I think elements of it can, but he will have to become a bit more selective. He's the best defenseman in this draft by a fairly large margin. But the threshold of a future No. 1 defenseman is pretty high, and I'm not sure Byram is there yet for me. -- Peters Team fit: There was a time, not too long ago, that the Avalanche's defense corps was one of the NHL's most underwhelming groups. That's going to feel like ancient history over the next several years. Byram joins potential 2019 Rookie of the Year Cale Makar, 20, smooth-skating Samuel Girard, 21, and Connor Timmins, 20, to form the backbone of that blue line for years to come. -- Wyshynski",,WHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Alex Turcotte,2019,NA,NA,,18,USA U18,NTDP,"He is a smart, two-way forward with an unrelenting motor and an ability to make plays in the offensive end of the ice. Turcotte is dogged in puck pursuit and remarkably strong, despite being average-sized. He is a fierce competitor but does not step over the line very often. He is not always flashy and doesn't always make the eye-popping play, but he makes the right plays. Turcotte goes hard to the net and into the corners, and he has the touch and plus-level vision to make plays under duress and find better options in tougher situations with the puck on his stick. He has deceptive feet, showcasing a good second gear that allows him to beat defenders wide or challenge them inside. -- Peters Team fit: Turcotte follows the speed-based model the Kings have been going with lately. On top of being a skilled player with excellent vision and superior hockey sense, he's a competitive two-way guy. The Kings have been building a stable of fast centers with Rasmus Kupari and Akil Thomas, both selected last year. This prospect pool gets a nice boost with a player with a ton of versatility. -- Peters",,NCAA (Wisconsin),NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Moritz Seider,2019,NA,NA,,18,Mannheim,Germany,"One of the most intriguing players in this entire draft, Seider is a strong skater for such a big guy and sees the ice particularly well. He can make plays at the offensive blue line and does a good job of absorbing and evading pressure in his own zone. There's some risk because Seider didn't have a ton of reps on special teams and in key situations this season, but he should be able to get those next season. -- Peters Team fit: The Red Wings do not have a ton of depth among defensemen in their system, but this was a shocker of a pick in Steve Yzerman's first draft. The value among the forwards still on the board is significant. You'd have to think the Red Wings bring him to North America immediately and allow him to develop in their own system in the AHL. -- Peters",,AHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Dylan Cozens,2019,NA,NA,,18,Lethbridge,WHL,"A strong skater who has an explosive burst in space, Cozens has that combination of size and speed that tantalizes scouts. There have been some questions about his overall hockey sense and skill level, but it's hard to argue with how his physical tools translate. The lack of high-end puck skills suggests that he might not be a No. 1 pivot down the road. That said, he has some two-way capabilities, with the balance tilting more offensively. -- Peters Team fit: Cozens brings a lot of speed, and he believes he can play in the NHL next season. I'm not sure I'm there yet for him, though. That said, I've liked his game from start to finish. He gives the Sabres a pretty versatile guy who could be a nice No. 2 center behind Jack Eichel in the long term. -- Peters",,WHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Philip Broberg,2019,NA,NA,,17,AIK,Sweden 2,"One of the best pure skaters in this draft, Broberg has all of the tools to eventually become a top-four defenseman in the NHL. There have been some moderate concerns about his hockey sense and playmaking abilities, but I think those will catch up to his feet eventually. He makes pretty good reads in the offensive zone, distributes well from the defensive zone and can use his feet in transition as well as, or better than, any defenseman in this draft. Broberg has a very good, quick and accurate shot from the point, looking for open lanes and possessing the mobility to find the best option. -- Peters Team fit: Broberg is an exceptional skater, and that had to be part of Edmonton's reasoning for grabbing him in the top 10. He can play the game at the Oilers' pace. I think he's going to need a little extra time before he's ready to jump into their lineup, but he has remarkable upside. Patience and good coaching will help him unlock it. -- Peters",,SHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Trevor Zegras,2019,NA,NA,,18,USA U18,NTDP,"With elite vision and passing skills, Zegras is excellent in dictating play from the half wall or making plays on the rush. He can play at any speed and can back defenders down coming through the neutral zone. His ability to gain the zone is rivaled only by Hughes' in the draft class, as Zegras has creativity and a good sense of how to find the soft areas to give him the best chance to make plays. He has a quick release and can score goals but is viewed more as a pass-first player. The biggest area of improvement for Zegras is his physical strength. He also seems to force plays sometimes, but I think that became less of a problem as this past season progressed. -- Peters Team fit: Zegras dropped further than I thought he would or should. He's an exceptional playmaker and will fit right into a prospect pool that already includes Isac Lundestrom, Max Comtois, Troy Terry, Sam Steel and Max Jones. For a rebuilding team, the Ducks have some nice building blocks up front. -- Peters",,NCAA (Boston University),NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Vasili Podkolzin,2019,NA,NA,,17,Neva St. Petersburg,Russia 2,"He remains under KHL contract for the next two years, but Podkolzin is an exceptional talent, with high-end skill and power in his game. He has a mean streak, gets on pucks quickly and can finish. Podkolzin wasn't dominating in the same way at the end of the season, and his club play was underwhelming, but I've maintained all year that he was never put in a great position to succeed this season because he played at three different levels in Russia. When Podkolzin is at his best, few in this class are better. He does a little bit of everything and does almost all of it very well. -- Peters Team fit: Podkolzin is a bit of risk because of that KHL contract, but I've heard from teams that those worries were largely quieted at the combine. Podkolzin won't be around for a couple of years, but he needed a few years to get his pro legs anyway. The Canucks have another high-end forward in their growing crop of young players with boatloads of skill. -- Peters",,KHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Victor Soderstrom,2019,NA,NA,,18,Brynas,Sweden,"A remarkably poised and mature defenseman, Soderstrom showcased his puck-moving talent and high-end hockey sense this season. However, I don't know that there's anything in particular that stands out about Soderstrom aside from the way he thinks the game. The skill is fine, the passing is good-to-great, his shot is OK and he gets pucks out of the zone well. He might be a jack of all trades but a master of none. -- Peters Team fit: The Coyotes needed more defensemen in their system, and Soderstrom has got a lot of upside. Having already played a year of pro hockey may adjust his timeline. I was surprised to see Arizona trade up, but the unexpected run on defensemen early in this draft really changed things and forced the Coyotes' hand to make sure they got their guy. -- Peters",,SHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Matthew Boldy,2019,NA,NA,,18,USA U18,NTDP,"Boldy is a wing who plays more like a center, a true 200-foot player who is as valuable defensively as he is offensively. He could afford to improve his skating some -- he does not have breakaway speed -- but he still gets around the sheet effectively. In the offensive end, Boldy has higher-end puck skills and creativity. He can make the plays in small areas and has an excellent, heavy, accurate shot. Boldy also possesses excellent vision and an ability to make accurate passes off the backhand and forehand. -- Peters Team fit: Boldy probably needs a few years in college, but he would have been so hard to pass on here. He brings size and versatility to the table and instantly becomes a top prospect in a shallow system. If the Wild ever convince Kirill Kaprizov to leave the KHL, they'd have some excellent pieces to keep building on. -- Peters",,NCAA (Boston College),NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Spencer Knight,2019,NA,NA,,18,USA U18,NTDP,"The things that makes Knight exceptional among his goaltending peers is elite hockey sense, tremendous athleticism balanced with controlled play, great footwork and size and elite puck-moving abilities. I don't put huge value on a goalie's puckhandling skills, but Knight's are so good it's hard not to mention. Knight has really grown a lot in his confidence and poise in the net. There's such little flash in Knight's game, and that's a good thing. He's just always in the right spot because he tracks and anticipates as well as any goalie prospect I've seen in the past few years. -- Peters Team fit: Knight is the top-ranked goalie in the draft, and now the future of the Panthers' net. And he would have some time to develop if the Panthers end up landing Sergei Bobrovsky in free agency to man their crease for the next several seasons. Per ESPN Stats & Information, Knight is the highest draft pick at the goalie position since Jack Campbell in 2010, who was drafted 11th by the Stars. -- Wyshynski",,NCAA (Boston College),NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Cam York,2019,NA,NA,,18,USA U18,NTDP,"York is often described as the modern-day defenseman. He jumps into plays with relative ease and has good instincts for when he has to get back. I thought his defensive game improved greatly over the past two seasons without sacrificing offense. His puck retrievals and sense for getting out of his own zone are among the best in this draft because he follows that first touch with decisive play. He still has to round out his game more and continue to build strength as an average-sized defenseman, but there's a lot to like in what he's done and how he progressed this season. -- Peters Team fit: The Flyers did extremely well in trading down to get an extra asset (No. 45 overall) while still getting a defenseman who plays the game the way the NHL is going. The Flyers have been loading up on prospects in recent years and have some really good forwards, so why not nab a high-end offensive defensman to get the puck to them? -- Peters",,NCAA (Michigan),NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Cole Caufield,2019,NA,NA,,18,USA U18,NTDP,"It isn't just that Caufield scored 72 goals this season, the most by any draft-eligible player in junior hockey by 21 goals. It's also how he scores them. Yes, Caufield is slight, but he has elite offensive sense. I haven't seen a prospect who has as keen a sense of time and space, and opponents have a hard time tracking Caufield on the ice. He's always moving, finding openings before anyone knows they're there. Combine that skill with an elite shot that isn't as heavy as it is ridiculously quick and accurate. -- Peters Team fit: Caufield's draft slide ends here, and the Canadiens get the best pure goal scorer in the draft. Other teams were clearly deterred by Caufield's size, but he'll spend his career trying to prove them wrong. It will take some seasoning for Caufield to make Montreal's roster, though. -- Kaplan",,NCAA (Wisconsin),NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Alex Newhook,2019,NA,NA,,18,Victoria,BCHL,"Newhook has high-end skills with skating that is probably just shy of elite. He can dance on the ice at times, using quick hand skills to beat defenders one-on-one while always knowing his next play. He gets shots off quickly and finds teammates well under pressure. Newhook requires patience because he needs to get stronger and needs to be harder to play against in more physical, tightly checked games, but that skill is tantalizing. -- Peters Team fit: After snagging the draft's best defenseman with the No. 4 pick, Colorado gets a highly skilled center in Newhook. He will be an especially good fit with the team's speed. The Avs may have wanted to go with a goalie in Knight here, but he wasn't available. -- Kaplan",,NCAA (Boston College),NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Peyton Krebs,2019,NA,NA,,18,Kootenay,WHL,"Krebs played on a bad Kootenay team this season but still managed to produce. A play-driving center, Krebs does a lot of little detail things well and can adequately take care of his own zone. Krebs can really survey the ice with excellent vision and above-average distribution skills in finding his teammates. The hockey sense is a separating skill. Krebs unfortunately did just sustain a serious Achilles injury during training this summer, but he is expected to be available for the beginning of the season. -- Peters Team fit: Another center for the Golden Knights to let percolate in their system. Vegas has Cody Glass and Jake Leschyshyn, both 20, down in the AHL. In theory, they'll have some time to develop, with Paul Stastny signed through 2021 and William Karlsson expected to sign an extension as a restricted free agent -- provided neither of them is moved this offseason. -- Wyshynski",,WHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Thomas Harley,2019,NA,NA,,17,Mississauga,OHL,"Postgame analysis and highlight show airing each night throughout the season from Barry Melrose and Linda Cohn. Watch on ESPN+ A higher-end offensive defenseman with size and mobility, Harley has plenty of upside in his game. He uses his skating to let things open up offensively and has the poise to be patient enough to find the right play. Sometimes he can get caught a little deep, but usually picks his spots pretty well. He comes with just average defensive-zone play, but he has a decent stick and can close on forwards decently well. Some scouts have wondered about his defensive sense. I think he has the know-how, but just hasn't figured out the balance between offense and defense yet. -- Peters Team fit: The Stars have only four picks in the draft (including none in the second or third round), so they can't really afford a miss here -- especially considering it's a system with a lot of needs. The Stars went heavy on forwards last year, so Harley's selection was no shock. He has good size and is exceptional offensively. -- Kaplan",,OHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Lassi Thomson,2019,NA,NA,,18,Kelowna,WHL,"Thomson is a good two-way defenseman who uses smarts over skill. His skating is good enough to get him up the ice and he's sturdy in his own zone, but there's not a lot in terms of overall puck skills or dynamicism. He is very decisive, making confident plays with the puck and allowing himself to get into space. There's not a lot of forcing it with him, and his offensive reads are pretty strong. -- Peters Team fit: Thomson was a bit of a reach here, but just because I'm not sold on his offensive game yet. The Senators have just about the deepest prospect pool in the league right now. I'd put Thomson behind Erik Brannstrom and Jacob Bernard-Docker on the D prospect depth chart. -- Peters",,Liiga or WHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Ville Heinola,2019,NA,NA,,18,Lukko,Finland,"Having spent the entire season playing quality minutes in Finland's top pro league, Heinola is especially intriguing. I think his skating is only average for a player his size, which keeps him from ranking a bit higher. There are more sub-6-foot defensemen in the NHL, but you still need to be able to skate at a high level. However, he makes up for it in his hockey sense. Coaches won't have to worry about him too much because he's so poised and moves the puck with incredible efficiency, even though his offensive skills are not necessarily dynamic. He defends decently well, closing on opposing forwards quickly. -- Peters Team fit: For the third time in the last four drafts, the Jets selected a Finnish player in the first round. Another Finn, Sami Niku, is a defenseman who has been shuttling back and forth from the main roster. The Jets don't have a lot of blue-chippers on the blue line in their system. Heinola is a smart defenseman who can develop. -- Wyshynski",,Liiga,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Samuel Poulin,2019,NA,NA,,18,Sherbrooke,QMJHL,"There are times when you see a player showing what he can do with his size and skill. There are other times when he disappears. The effort needs to be better. Aside from that, the skill he has in that sturdy frame of his is tantalizing. -- Peters Team fit: I listed Poulin as my player most likely to be overdrafted. The Penguins have a fairly shallow pool and don't get to pick in the first round very often. I view this as a high-risk, high-reward pick in this range just because I question Poulin's overall hockey sense and consistency of effort. An intriguing prospect nonetheless. -- Peters",,QMJHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Tobias Bjornfot,2019,NA,NA,,18,Djurgarden Jr.,Sweden Jr.,"Bjornfot is one of the smarter players in this draft. His ability to read plays in all zones is exceptional, and he always puts himself in a good spot. Despite a relative lack of high-end skill, he's a good passer and has shown flashes of more offensive capabilities. Bjornfot keeps it simple when he has to, allowing his vision and mobility to do the work for him. With elite defensive sense, he is so hard to play against in his own zone and limits mistakes when he has the puck. He can get it up ice quickly, too. -- Peters Team fit: This was the pick Los Angeles acquired in the Jake Muzzin trade, so one defenseman in, one defenseman out I guess. The Swede is the first defenseman they've drafted in their past 10 picks, and the first defenseman the Kings have taken in the first round since Derek Forbort at No. 15 in 2010. Side note: The arena is playing ""regionally appropriate"" music when each pick walks to the stage, including Abba for Bjornfot. Hopefully the Kings don't look back and exclaim ""Mamma Mia"" at this pick in the next few years. -- Wyshynski",,SHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Simon Holmstrom,2019,NA,NA,,18,HV71 Jr.,Sweden Jr.,"Good size and hockey sense have helped Holmstrom lift his draft stock throughout the season. He has a very good shot that he can get off from anywhere. The puck really zips off his stick. His puck skills are OK, and pretty average in terms of one-on-one stick skills, but he gets himself into good positions and helps create space for his linemates. Holmstrom has good physical strength which helps him protect the puck well, and he has a little power element to his game. But does he have enough skill to create on his own? -- Peters Team fit: Holmstrom has been projected all over the place during the draft process. The Isles have really bolstered their defensive pipeline, so Lou Lamoriello & Co. taking a forward here was not much of a surprise. Holmstrom has been a hard guy on whom to get a read, but he finished the season strong and the Isles won't need him for a few more years anyway. -- Peters",,SHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Phillip Tomasino,2019,NA,NA,,17,Niagara,OHL,"Tomasino is an exciting player because of his elite-level skating ability. He looks like a gazelle on ice with his fluidity and quickness. With a quick release and solid vision, he's a true shot-pass threat in the offensive zone, too. Tomasino can play in a variety of situations and handles the flow of games very well. The important element, however, is the speed at which he plays the game. He's fast both up and down the ice, and quick in small areas. He has a good work ethic, a willingness to go to the hard areas of the ice and a competitiveness on the puck when he gets there. -- Peters Team fit: I think this is one of the more perfect player-to-team fits. Tomasino plays the game at a high pace and is one of the better skaters in the draft. The Preds want to push the pace and that's exactly what he does as a pass-shot threat down the middle or on the wing. -- Peters",,OHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Connor McMichael,2019,NA,NA,,18,London,OHL,"McMichael is one of the fastest players in the draft. His shot really improved this season with a good, quick release. He competes, too, playing with tenacity, and his ability to create on the rush is among his more important attributes. As he gets stronger, he's going to be difficult to handle down low. -- Peters Team fit: The good news for McMichael is that the past six forwards the Capitals have selected in the first round all made a considerable impact in the NHL: Jakub Vrana, Andre Burakovsky, Tom Wilson, Filip Forsberg, Evgeny Kuznetsov and Marcus Johansson. The good news for the Capitals is that they got a center from the London Knights who made a huge leap forward in production this season. -- Wyshynski",,OHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Jakob Pelletier,2019,NA,NA,,18,Moncton,QMJHL,"Pelletier has quick, shifty skills that have served him well in one-on-one situations and getting pucks into the zone. His skating is fine, but perhaps not overly dynamic for a player of his size. But he makes up for that with his energetic, fearless style of play. His game needs work away from the puck, as there are some concerns he's a tad too one-dimensional. -- Peters Team fit: It was a bit of a surprise the Flames didn't take one of the two big defensemen available, considering that they used all five of their picks in last year's draft on forwards. However, the productive winger adds much-needed skill into Calgary's prospect pool. -- Kaplan",,QMJHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Nolan Foote,2019,NA,NA,,18,Kelowna,WHL,"Foote had a pretty strong season, scoring 36 goals, even though he played much of it with a fractured wrist. He is a good, not great, skater who uses his body well and can win along the boards. His puck skills are average, but he has exceptional hockey sense and can make good passes in all zones, and whether or not there's pressure. Foote also has enough edge in his game to win a lot of battles down low. -- Peters Team fit: The Lightning put their second Foote forward in the NHL draft. They selected Cal Foote, a defenseman from the Kelowna Rockets (WHL) in 2017 at No. 14 overall. Now they have his younger brother Nolan Foote, a wing, at No. 27 this season. A bit of a reach? Very much, as he was projected by most as a second-round pick. But what were they going to do with just one Foote? Hop around? -- Wyshynski",,WHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Ryan Suzuki,2019,NA,NA,,18,Barrie,OHL,"Suzuki is one of the better playmakers in the draft. He has elite vision and anticipates exceptionally well. One of the primary complaints among scouts is a relative lack of intensity and compete level, and there are some issues with consistency that arose when he wasn't getting to the middle of the ice enough. He's a cerebral player who could afford to make quicker decisions, but there's very little questioning his puck skills and his ability to find teammates. -- Peters Team fit: The Hurricanes picked center Ryan Suzuki, the brother of Nick Suzuki, a Canadiens prospect (and first-round pick of Vegas in 2017). The knock on Ryan is that he's too much of a perimeter player, which clashes a bit with what we've seen from the Hurricanes lately, as they try to become a heavier team. -- Kaplan",,OHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Brayden Tracey,2019,NA,NA,,18,Moose Jaw,WHL,"The WHL's Rookie of the Year and one of the fastest risers in this draft class, Tracey has really good puck skills and vision, with an ability to make plays under pressure. His skating is probably closer to average, but I don't view it as a hindrance. He gets to the hard areas well enough and can make some decent plays on the rush. -- Peters Team fit: Tracey has been one of the real rising prospects in this draft class. I came around late on him and still couldn't put him over some of the other guys I had on my board. I also thought the Ducks might focus on defense, but clearly they didn't like what was left enough to pass on a guy who had 81 points in the WHL this season. More depth for their forward group. -- Peters",,WHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,John Beecher,2019,NA,NA,,18,USA U18,NTDP,"An exceptional athlete, Beecher has high-end speed. He's one of the best-graded skaters in this draft, even at his size. He could use a little bit more in the puck-skills department, and his offensive sense is average at best. He gets behind, around and through defenses very well with his wheels. -- Peters Team fit: The Bruins didn't have a first-round pick last year, and they've had mixed results drafting in the first round over the past few years. Boston went with a bit of a surprise in Beecher, a big forward with incredible speed but average skill. -- Kaplan",,NCAA (Michigan),NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Ryan Johnson,2019,NA,NA,,17,Sioux Falls,USHL,"Johnson is one of the best skating defensemen in this entire class. He's an exceptional defender who performed at his best in big games this season. But he is a pretty raw talent when it comes to ability to make plays in the offensive zone. In faster-paced games, he focuses a lot more on defending, and I don't know that he has the offensive sense to make effective plays up ice. -- Peters Team fit: Johnson is an elite skating defenseman who defends at an especially high level. He's also a winner, having won titles at the World Junior A Challenge and the Clark Cup with Sioux Falls. That's got to speak to an organization that's trying to turn the tide. The offensive upside is limited, but I think there could be a bit more to give there. After all, this was only his first season in junior hockey after playing Triple-A youth hockey in California. He's just scratching the surface. -- Peters", Where Johnson is most likely to play in 2019-20: NCAA (Minnesota) ,,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Alexis Lafreniere,2020,NA,NA,,18,Rimouski,QMJHL,"Over the past 20 years, only two players 18 years old or younger had a points-per-game average higher than Lafreniere's 2.15 this season: Sidney Crosby and Jonathan Drouin. Lafreniere thinks the game at a high level, with elite anticipation and an understanding of what to do with the puck immediately after he gets it. He has a physical edge and initiates contact more than most top picks of recent years. -- Peters Team fit: The Rangers already have two excellent left wingers in Artemi Panarin and Chris Kreider, which relieves some pressure on Lafreniere. The top prospect can transition to the NHL in a middle- or bottom-six role, similar to the way 2019 No. 2 pick Kaapo Kakko did this past season. More importantly, as New York finishes out its rebuild, Lafreniere becomes a key piece of the new 27-and-under core, which includes Mika Zibanejad, Pavel Buchnevich, Ryan Strome, Kakko, Filip Chytil, Jacob Trouba, Adam Fox, Tony DeAngelo and Igor Shesterkin. -- Kaplan",,NHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Quinton Byfield,2020,NA,NA,,18,Sudbury,OHL,"Byfield has game-to-game consistency concerns but was fifth in the OHL in terms of points per game (1.82). At his best, he is a dominant force with elite-level speed, especially considering his size. He thinks the game extremely well, with good vision and a playmaker's touch. Byfield's defensive game needs maturation, but his instincts with the puck are very strong. If everything goes right in his development, he has a chance to be special. -- Peters Team fit: Byfield is a little farther away from the NHL than Tim Stutzle. But the Kings have been playing the long game with their rebuild, so they can wait. He's a franchise center, an understudy for and successor to Anze Kopitar. And let's not discount this point: This is the highest a Black player has ever been selected in the NHL draft. That, plus his personality, could be huge in one of the key NHL markets in the U.S. -- Wyshynski",,NHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Tim Stutzle,2020,NA,NA,,18,Mannheim,Germany,"There is a sense of ease in Stutzle's game. He has high-end puckhandling and skating abilities along with elite vision and hockey sense. He has a nice release and good shot, but his hands work best when he's snapping passes, especially down low. He uses the ice that's given to him and often makes the play, but he doesn't force things. -- Peters Team fit: GM Pierre Dorion didn't overthink this; Stutzle was the best player available. Ottawa -- which no longer has any players from its team that made the 2017 Eastern Conference final -- desperately needs playmakers. Stutzle, who has been compared to Patrick Kane, is just that. He'll hopefully create chemistry with Brady Tkachuk on the Senators' top line, but there's no rush for Stutzle's development, considering Ottawa is still in rebuild mode. -- Kaplan",,AHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Lucas Raymond,2020,NA,NA,,18,Frolunda,Sweden,"Raymond had 14 points in nine games in Sweden's under-20 league. His one-on-one skills, skating and willingness to battle for his ice are plus traits. -- Peters Team fit: The Red Wings are in a deep rebuild, from the foundation up. Raymond can easily be a pillar in that reconstruction. An enormously talented winger who has drawn comparisons to Mitch Marner and Artemi Panarin, he is the kind of offensive player GM Steve Yzerman had in his core with the Lightning and clearly wants in his Detroit nucleus. Plus, let's face it: Yzerman and draft general Kris Draper know their way around a talented Swedish player or two. -- Wyshynski",,SHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Jake Sanderson,2020,NA,NA,,18,USA U18,NTDP,"An incredible skater and pure two-way defender, Sanderson has risen up the charts this season. His offensive skills are not necessarily the strongest points of his game, but he has a great understanding of how to make plays when they're available to him. And defensively, Sanderson is one of the more gifted blueliners in this class with good physical strength and a propensity to initiate contact. -- Peters Team fit: When the Senators realized how deep this draft class was, they stockpiled picks and kept both No. 3 and No. 5. They ended up with two excellent, albeit different, players. Joining Stutzle is Sanderson, a big physical defenseman -- an area of need for the organization. Sanderson is more of a defensive blueliner, compared to the other top defenseman, Jamie Drysdale, who plays a more offensive game. Sanderson's selection marks the third straight year the Senators have drafted a University of North Dakota player. -- Kaplan",,NCAA,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Jamie Drysdale,2020,NA,NA,,18,Erie,OHL,"Drysdale is an effortless, deceptive skater who can make a lot of plays with his feet in terms of opening up ice. His defending is adequate, though he still needs to get stronger and have a more consistent detail in his own end. He has excellent offensive tools, with a quick shot and confident puck-moving capabilities. -- Peters Team fit: GM Bob Murray and the Ducks used to reliably select defensemen in the first round. Witness their run of Cam Fowler (2010), Hampus Lindholm (2012), Shea Theodore (2013) and Jacob Larsson (2015). Drysdale is the first one they've taken since then, and he's a great blueliner to lead the next wave for Anaheim, earning some comparisons to Cale Makar. It's a very strong pick for a position where the franchise needed a blue-chipper. -- Wyshynski",,OHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Alexander Holtz,2020,NA,NA,,18,Djurgarden,Sweden,"After tacking on muscle last year, Holtz handled the pro grind pretty well in Sweden. He is a natural offensive talent, with an elite release and quick hands. He has vision and offensive sense that challenge opposing defenses, along with the strength to drive the net. His skating is very good, and there's power in his stride. -- Peters Team fit: With both of the top defenseman off the board, the Devils went with a scoring winger. GM Tom Fitzgerald has said the timeline for his team's rebuild is whenever Jack Hughes (No. 1 pick of the 2019 draft) and Nico Hischier (No. 1 in 2017) are ready. Both Hughes and Hischier are natural centers, so it makes sense to add a goal scorer to develop with them. Holtz has the creativity to keep up with a player like Hughes. -- Kaplan",,SHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Jack Quinn,2020,NA,NA,,19,Ottawa,OHL,"His scoring ability pops, and his skating has improved quite a bit. Quinn also has really good hands and can wire pucks. He has a really strong sense of the offensive zone and knows how to get to good ice to become more dangerous. -- Peters Team fit: This isn't a big reach for GM Kevyn Adams and the Sabres but a reach nonetheless, as most mock drafts had Quinn going outside the top 10. Thus, he was not the best player available. That said, he's a fleet skater with one of the better shots among the top dozen prospects. This is good news for a team that really needed to deepen its prospect pool on the wing, and even better news for Jack Eichel, who would certainly like some dynamic scoring talent on his wing sooner rather than later. -- Wyshynski",,OHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Marco Rossi,2020,NA,NA,,19,Ottawa,OHL,"His 2.14 points per game in the OHL ranks fifth among players 18 years old or younger over the past 20 years. Rossi is good in small areas, engages with defenders and can protect the puck fairly well. His skating doesn't blow you away, but he's good on his edges and uses high-end hockey sense to make plays under pressure. The power and strength he generates from his lower half alleviates size concerns for me, too. -- Peters Team fit: Ever since taking over as GM in August 2019, Bill Guerin has commented about the lack of No. 1 centers, both on the current roster and in the pipeline. So with two of the top centers still available, it was an obvious pounce for Minnesota. Rossi is more NHL-ready than Cole Perfetti. That makes more sense for the Wild, which were making their first top-10 pick in eight years and are trying to avoid a full-on rebuild. -- Kaplan",,OHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Cole Perfetti,2020,NA,NA,,18,Saginaw,OHL,"He can score, he can make plays and his skill is elite. His vision and offensive sense are outstanding, too. He can extend plays and seems to always have a plan with the puck on his stick. Perfetti has a pure release on his shot and snaps passes about as well as anyone else in the class. His skating is closer to average. -- Peters Team fit: The Perfetti drop ends with the Jets, who snag one of the draft's better high-end offensive players. He brings great hockey sense, solid playmaking skills, a quick shot and the ability to end up on the wing or at center, which is nice flexibility for the Jets to have. Tumbling down to No. 10 after many had him projected in the top five should be ample motivation for him, too. -- Wyshynski",,OHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Yaroslav Askarov,2020,NA,NA,,18,Neva St. Petersburg,Russia 2,"Askarov is among the best goaltending prospects to enter the draft in some time. He is such a monster in the crease, as good as any goalie I've seen at his age going post to post. He never quits on plays, and while he can make the big save, he makes a lot of his work look easy. There's explosiveness and power in the way he plays the position, but he can keep it quiet and simple, too. -- Peters Team fit: A big trend emerging from the 2020 playoffs: The NHL is becoming a two-goaltender league. The Predators have their tandem for now in Juuse Saros and Pekka Rinne, but they saw Askarov -- considered the best goalie prospect since Carey Price -- as too irresistible of a pick sitting at No. 11, despite the organizational need for scorers. Rinne, 37, comes off the books after next season. -- Kaplan",,KHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Anton Lundell,2020,NA,NA,,19,HIFK,Finland,"Lundell has two professional seasons under his belt already, showcasing high-end vision and playmaking skills while showing a commitment to play defensively. His defensive value is highest among forwards in this range; there's detail in his game at both ends of the ice. His puck skills are just average, but he makes things happen. -- Peters Team fit: The Finland connection runs deep for the Panthers. Aleksander Barkov is their No. 1 center and only untouchable player. Florida GM Bill Zito worked under Finnish hockey godfather Jarmo Kekalainen with the Blue Jackets, and one assumes they had a conversation or two about Lundell. The center is not too far away from being NHL ready, which is even better news for a team looking to piece together a contender sooner rather than later. It's a good fit for Lundell, too, as he can learn under one of the best two-way centers on the planet. -- Wyshynski",,Liiga,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Seth Jarvis,2020,NA,NA,,18,Portland,WHL,"Quick hands and solid north-south speed contributed to Jarvis improving his WHL scoring total by nearly 60 points over the previous season to finish second overall in the league with 98 points. He doesn't have great size, but the speed and growth in skill suggest a higher ceiling than I previously thought Jarvis had. -- Peters Team fit: It's the pick that originally belonged to the Maple Leafs, but Jarvis is headed to Carolina thanks to the Canes taking on Patrick Marleau's salary. GM Don Waddell telegraphed that his team needed offense, so it's not a surprise they bring in a player with a ton of offensive skill. Jarvis has speed, too, and that should translate to the Canes' style. -- Kaplan",,WHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Dylan Holloway,2020,NA,NA,,19,Wisconsin,Big Ten,"Holloway was one of the most anticipated prospects of this class but struggled to adapt to the college game, albeit with a Wisconsin team that vastly underperformed. He is still one of the better skaters in this draft class and the physical tools are there, but his play away from the puck needs to improve. -- Peters Team fit: The Oilers signaled before the draft that they weren't keen on taking a defenseman because they have depth at that position. This isn't always the way it works in the NHL, which is very much a ""best player available"" draft. Is Holloway better than defenseman Kaiden Guhle? That's arguable. But he is a strong addition as a power forward, earning some Chris Kreider comparisons -- no doubt for his NCAA roots and his ability to get to the net like the Rangers' wrecking ball. -- Wyshynski",,NCAA,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Rodion Amirov,2020,NA,NA,,19,Ufa,Russia,"An especially skilled and crafty winger, Amirov has some of the best skill in this draft. He has remarkably fluid puckhandling abilities and a deceptive, quick release on his shot. Amirov also competes down low and extends plays along the wall with good skating and creative puck work. -- Peters Team fit: On Monday, GM Kyle Dubas told reporters he thought the 2020 draft is ""certainly"" a deep one, so he's hoping he found a diamond in the rough in the left winger. Amirov is already playing in the KHL, which means he should be pro ready as soon as he comes over. While forward isn't the biggest area of need currently (it's defense), Amirov fits the Leafs' brand of hockey extremely well. -- Kaplan",,KHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Kaiden Guhle,2020,NA,NA,,18,Prince Albert,WHL,"Emily Kaplan and Greg Wyshynski take you around the NHL with the latest news, big questions and special guests every episode. Listen here » One of the draft's most athletic players, Guhle is an especially mobile defenseman who packs a punch. The concern is in his overall offensive upside, though he has a nice quick shot from the point. But his full complement of tools -- with skating and hockey sense being among his best -- gives me reason to believe he can and will progress offensively. -- Peters Team fit: The Canadiens had a chance to draft a French-Canadian kid named Hendrix Lapierre, who earned favorable comparisons to Patrice Bergeron, and they ... didn't? That's OK. Guhle is a solid choice at No. 16, as the No. 8-ranked North American skater whose acceleration and offensive skill set earned him comparisons to Ducks defender Cam Fowler. He joins Alexander Romanov as blue-chippers on the blue line in a robust Canadiens prospect system. -- Wyshynski",,WHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Lukas Reichel,2020,NA,NA,,18,Eisbaren Berlin,Germany,"Reichel has great hands and creativity. He creates space and can extend plays. He also makes really smart reads with the puck on his stick and processes the game quickly. -- Peters Team fit: The Blackhawks would have been in on Yaroslav Askarov had the goalie been available here; Chicago needs to restock its goalie pipeline. Instead, the Blackhawks got a skilled, high-upside forward (Chicago had selected a defenseman with two of its past three first-round picks). Reichel is the second German to be drafted this year. GM Stan Bowman got a first-hand look at scouting the winger when Reichel's team played against the Blackhawks last fall during the NHL's Global Series. -- Kaplan",,DEL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Dawson Mercer,2020,NA,NA,,18,Chicoutimi,QMJHL,"Mercer has great character and work ethic, but don't sleep on his skill level and hockey sense. He is committed to playing at both ends of the ice and can engage physically despite not being the biggest guy. I like his release and ability to create off the rush, too, and he adapts to situations well. -- Peters Team fit: In the eyes of Devils general manager Tom Fitzgerald, the next decade probably looks like this: Jack Hughes, Nico Hischier and Mercer up the middle. That is if Mercer doesn't shift over to the wing, where the slippery forward can also be effective. The Devils have a lot of holes to fill, but clearly their general manager, an ex-NHL forward, believes the best options so far have been up front. -- Wyshynski",,QMJHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Braden Schneider,2020,NA,NA,,19,Brandon,WHL,"Schneider can control the net front both physically and with excellent anticipation. Schneider always seems to find himself in the right position, making good reads in the defensive zone and keeping a good gap on the rush. The offensive elements of his game are more understated, but he jumps into plays and distributes well. -- Peters Team fit: The Rangers gave up a third-round pick to move up three spots, as they clearly fell in love with drafting an in-your-face, rugged defenseman. He is a nice complement to Alexis Lafreniere, who also plays a physical brand of hockey. Schneider, who has cited Shea Weber as his role model, loves to lay out big hits and should endear himself to fans at Madison Square Garden. -- Kaplan",,WHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Shakir Mukhamamadullin,2020,NA,NA,,18,Ufa,Russia,"Mukhamadullin's decision-making leaves a lot to be desired at this point. But he has a base of tools with which a team can work, especially with that big frame and solid mobility. He got into KHL games this season but had limited usage. -- Peters Team fit: Right before the Devils' pick, the Rangers traded up to grab Braden Schneider, a physical defenseman with a high compete level. A source said they thought the Devils wanted to draft him, so they hopped the line. The Devils then had the reach of the first round (at that point) in selecting Mukhamadullin, who wasn't projected to go in the first round as the 17th-rated non-North American skater and sixth-ranked defenseman on that list. Like Schneider, he's a stay-at-home type. Unlike Schneider, he has experience playing at the pro level. But knowing what was on the draft board at this point, it's hard to believe the Devils couldn't have traded down and still had him there. -- Wyshynski",,KHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Yegor Chinakhov,2020,NA,NA,,19,Omsk 2,Russia Jr.,"The Russian is a second-year draft-eligible player. Those types of players don't typically get long looks, especially when they don't even play for the Russian national team at the U20 level. That said, Chinakov is off to a ridiculous start to the KHL season with seven points in 12 games. Prior to that, he was one of the top players in Russia's U20 league. He has a frame he can grow into more and a high-end shot. His ability to score at the pro level is intriguing, but he's still a player who has a lot of development time ahead. -- Peters Team fit: GM Jarmo Kekalainen has always acted off conviction, so it feels on-brand to pick off the board, like he did with this pick. (Chinakhov at No. 21 was so unexpected that neither the NBC nor Sportsnet broadcast appeared to have much prepared on the player). The 19-year-old winger has been a riser after a hot start in the KHL and could give the Blue Jackets much-needed scoring. Columbus is hoping this isn't a reach but rather the team landed on a late-bloomer. -- Kaplan",,KHL,NA,NA,NA,NA

Cole Perfetti, C, Saginaw-OHL 5. Lucas Raymond, LW, Frolunda-SwedenSee full top-100 draft rankings » Concussion and neck problems potentially derailed a season that got off to a spectacular start at the Hlinka Gretzky Cup. Lapierre is a high-end talent with excellent vision and puck skills, though his QMJHL performance when he was healthy -- or at least moderately healthy -- was not in line with his previously lofty projections. -- Peters Team fit: The Capitals traded up to select Lapierre, and he'll be worth the third-round pick they anted up if he can stay healthy. Now, that's asking a lot, considering his three concussions in a 10-month span in 2019. That's a little scary. But when a young forward has the playmaking puck skills and skating ability that Lapierre does, with favorable comparisons to a player like Jonathan Toews as a two-way center, it's worth the shot. This could easily be one of those picks for which hockey scholars in the future wonder how one of the NHL's better centers could have lasted this long in the draft. -- Wyshynski",,QMJHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Tyson Foerster,2020,NA,NA,,18,Barrie,OHL,"A solid scorer who gets up and down the ice well, Foerster navigates the offensive zone with great awareness. He led Barrie in scoring by 33 points. He has a good variety of release points on his shot and can make plays off the pass. -- Peters Team fit: Heading into the draft, the Flyers needed forward depth, and they had plenty of decent options available. In Foerster, Philadelphia gets one of the best shooters in the draft. Foerster has high-upside production and great size, and plays with grit, but he needs to work on his skating. That said, Foerster has already proven he can make improvements, nearly quadrupling his point total from 23 points as a rookie in the OHL to 80 last season. If the Flyers believe they can fix Foerster's skating, they found a gem late in the first round. -- Kaplan",,OHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Connor Zary,2020,NA,NA,,19,Kamloops,WHL,"One of the best puck distributors in this class, Zary has high-end vision and is especially decisive with the puck on his stick. He wastes few plays. Zary finished fifth in the WHL with 86 points and was a leader on a resurgent Kamloops team. He has some edge, as well. -- Peters Team fit: The Flames traded down twice before making their first pick of the draft, and it ended up being Zary. The Flames don't have a ton of quality depth at the position in their system beyond Mathias Emilio Pettersen -- if he ends up in the middle -- so the addition of Zary here makes sense. He's a solid two-way forward with a competitive streak at both ends of the ice. He fancies his game like that of Canucks star Bo Horvat, though there is some question if he has that level of skill. -- Wyshynski",,WHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Justin Barron,2020,NA,NA,,18,Halifax,QMJHL,"Barron's season was derailed by a blood clot. His hockey sense is exceptional, and Barron can get involved at both ends of the ice, although I'd grade his defensive value more favorably than his ability to produce. -- Peters Team fit: Barron might have slipped a bit because of blood clot issues that kept him sidelined for most of last season, but the Avalanche are looking long term here. Barron is a terrific skater and plays a sound game. Colorado has to feel great about the young defensive group it has built. It's highlighted by Calder Trophy winner Cale Makar, but also includes Bowen Byram, Samuel Girard, Ryan Graves, Drew Helleson and Conor Timmins. The blue line is a huge area of strength for the Avalanche for years to come, which gives GM Joe Sakic plenty of flexibility. -- Kaplan",,QMJHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Jake Neighbours,2020,NA,NA,,18,Edmonton,WHL,"Neighbours is a sturdy player who is tough to take off the puck. His skating stride is a bit clunky, but he gets where he needs to be, delivers body checks and makes things more difficult on opposing players in all zones. It's tougher to project him as a likely top-six player, but he certainly has the versatility to fit into a variety of roles for a team. -- Peters Team fit: The Blues selected a very Blues-esque player in Jake Neighbours. He has a very high compete level, is strong at the net and is tough to take off the puck. GM Doug Armstrong and coach Craig Berube love their sandpaper guys, and Neighbours seems to fit that mold pretty well. A number of the mock drafts had him going early in the second round, so this is a moderate reach but nothing too strenuous. -- Wyshynski",,WHL,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Jacob Perreault,2020,NA,NA,,18,Sarnia,OHL,"Among the best pure goal scorers in this class, Perreault has an elite shot. His one-timers are deadly, and he changes up his release points on his shot often, which makes him much more deceptive for opposing goalies. Consistency of effort and play away from the puck continue to be areas scouts harp on about Perreault's overall projection, but the scoring ability kept him in my top 20. -- Peters Team fit: This is a pick that the rebuilding Ducks acquired from the Bruins as part of the Ondrej Kase trade. As they did with their earlier pick, the Ducks went for the best available player. Perrault is the son of former NHL player Yanic Perreault, and was one of the best goal scorers in the OHL.

Vision is solid. The skating is fine. Brisson finished second in USHL scoring with 59 points in 45 games, but he still needs to get stronger and a bit more aggressive in the middle of the ice, though. -- Peters Team fit: There was a lot of speculation about where Brisson would land; his father, Pat, is one of the NHL's super agents, representing Sidney Crosby, Patrick Kane, Jonathan Toews -- as well as Jonathan Marchessault and Nicolas Roy, two of his son's future teammates. In his own right, Brendan Brisson is one of the best Americans in this year's draft, and he's a player who has been improving at every level.

ESPN,Mavrik Bourque,2020,NA,NA,,18,Shawinigan,QMJHL,"Among U18 players in the QMJHL, no player had more points than Bourque's 71 -- and his 1.45 points per game led his age peers by a substantial margin. He has some natural offensive ability, with an excellent shot, especially off the pass. Bourque doesn't have an imposing frame, but he has quick hands and a good idea of how to spin the wheels offensively for his team. I think his skating could stand to improve, but it's not a major drawback for him. -- Peters Team fit: A lot of mock drafts had Bourque going a few picks before the Stars got a chance to get him at No. 30.

Rasmus Dahlin, No. 1 overall in 2018, hasn't quite leveled up to franchise defenseman status yet, but he's only 21 years old.

He was projected by many to go as high as No. 3 overall to the Ducks. He drops here to the Coyotes, who get the kind of goal scorer their prospect pipeline lacks.

Perhaps trading down to where they thought he'd end up would be too much of a guessing game for the Senators. They wanted him, they had the No. 10 pick and they got him.

After Keith Petruzzelli opted not to sign with the Red Wings, the team didn't really have anyone in the mold of a goalie of the future. Cossa fits that mold, and fits the M.O. of GM Steve Yzerman.

Mailloux has been doing work away from the spotlight since the incident, beginning the process to earn a second chance in the 2022. But that process has just started. It isn't even guaranteed that he will return to play for the London Knights next season. For the Canadiens to select him in this draft is calculated and unsettling. There's a victim here who just saw her assailant still rewarded with a first-round selection despite unofficially pulling himself out of the draft. But all that established ... Montreal had two picks in the second round. Another two in the third round. Another three in the fourth round. Mailloux was considered a lower first-round talent before his transgressions. His decision to recuse himself from the draft, and the reasons behind that decision, undoubtedly would have sent him plummeting down the board.

After the COVID-19 pandemic cost him all of the 2020-21 season, he returned in 2021-22 with an underwhelming start that produced only 22 points in 19 games. He finished strong with 94 points in 63 games but many scouts (rightly) began predicting Wright had opened the door for others to unseat him as the consensus No. 1. That's exactly what happened. New Jersey had the No. 2 and didn't need another center; Arizona went with a different center at No. 3. The Kraken finally pulled Wright off the board. While not a generational talent, Wright has the potential to develop into a No. 1 center. At 6-0 and 191 pounds, Wright possesses good size and is a strong skater who's impressively elusive with quickness to beat defenders to pucks. Add to that excellent hockey sense, outstanding playmaking ability and finish around the net. No doubt his slide down the draft board will motivate Wright when he does reach the NHL.

The Coyotes traded for San Jose's No. 11 overall pick in exchange for picks No. 27, No. 34 and No. 45. Why not? Geekie is a great choice. The 6-3 center had 24 goals and 70 points in 63 games with the WHL's Winnipeg Ice last season. He's still a raw talent, but with great potential, possessing a unique skill set that has mixed size and speed to excellent returns in his junior hockey career.

ESPN,Denton Mateychuk,2022,NA,NA,7/12/04,NA,Moose Jaw,WHL,,"Interesting pick here for the Blue Jackets. Mateychuk wasn't projected to go quite this high. But with Korchinski and Mintyukov off the board -- and Columbus' desire to go defense -- Mateychuk was the choice. He loves to get involved in the play, sometimes so much so that it becomes a detriment in overcommitting. The key will be to figure out when to lead the rush and when to be more conservative. But that's correctable. His defensive game is good and he has a high hockey IQ. The Columbus back end was gutted when the team traded Seth Jones and David Savard away in recent years. It looks a lot better now with David Jiricek and Denton Mateychuk ready to join Zach Werenski and Adam Boqvist. -- Wyshynski",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Frank Nazar,2022,NA,NA,1/14/04,NA,US U-18,NTDP,,"Chicago plucked another U.S. national team development program player in Nazar. What the Detroit native lacks in size, he makes up for in tenacity, speed and agility. Nazar showed off his explosive potential popping in 28 goals and 70 points in 56 games, and was reliably relentless in every facet of his game. Nazar's instincts stand out too, in the way he can feel and elude pressure from defensemen to create space. Nazar could develop into an impactful top-six skater for the Blackhawks as he continues adding strength and honing the skills in his repertoire. He's similar in ways to the player Chicago traded away earlier in the day, DeBrincat. The Blackhawks would be lucky to see Nazar grow into a similar kind of difference-maker. -- Shilton",,NA,NA,NA,NA

On the ice, he plays a rugged power forward game that draws comparisons to Matthew Tkachuk. McGroarty brings leadership potential as well from captaining the USNTDP program. He pocketed 35 goals and 69 points in 54 games last season, which represented a significant jump in his development (19 points in 30 games) from the previous campaign.

He had 15 points in eight games to lead the under-18 world championship, including five goals. His shot is his greatest asset, and he uses it well on special teams, but he can also move the puck well. He had just 26 games of pro experience in his first SHL season, so he needs a little more time to cook. But his offensive ceiling is high. Huh, a Swedish prospect drafted by a front office that features Patrick Allvin and the Sedins? Go figure. -- Wyshynski",,NA,NA,NA,NA

The 18-year-old lit it up with Djurgardens of the Swedish Jr. Hockey League last season, posting nine goals and 42 points in 32 games. He didn't have the same success in a stint with Djurgarden's top team, adding zero points in 11 games, a disparity that contributed to Ostlund being a somewhat polarizing prospect. He's got great speed, agility and creative playmaking ability, but has gaps to fill in his consistency and reliability before making a jump to the pros. The skill is there though, which has to excite the Sabres. -- Shilton",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Joakim Kemell,2022,NA,NA,4/27/04,NA,JYP,FINLAND,,"The wait is over for Kemell. I spoke with an NHL draft analyst who said the most shocking part of the first round was seeing this elite goal-scoring prospect tumble out of the top 10 -- and continue to tumble all the way to No. 17 and the Predators. The reason: He's 5-9 and plays on the wing. For all the talk about this becoming a ""small man's league,"" the 2022 draft had a surprising emphasis on size. Kemell had 15 goals in his first pro season in Liiga. He's got terrific hands and a dynamic offensive game, but how that projects to the NHL has been a mystery scouts have been trying to solve for a while. -- Wyshynski",,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bichsel asserted himself well in the SHL last season with that punishing presence, which will make him a fan favorite in Dallas down the line. The Swiss native showcases good decision-making on the ice, uses his stick well and uses that frame to take away space from on-rushing forwards.

Ostlund was off the board at No. 16 to the Sabres, leaving Ohgren at No. 19 for the Wild. Ohgren is bigger and has a better all-around game. He's more of a goal scorer than a playmaker. Ostlund was seen as having more upside, and hence went earlier. But the Wild add a center to their mix at the position that includes Marco Rossi. -- Wyshynski",,NA,NA,NA,NA

Miroshnichenko is a 6-1 left wing built like a truck who can skate like the wind and loves to fire pucks with his rocket shot from the faceoff circle on the power play. Sound like any NHLer you know? But this pick has a lot more to it than mini-Ovechkin fantasies. Miroshnichenko had a Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis earlier this year, but has completed his treatments and has returned to training. He's also currently playing for Omsk Krylia in Russia's VHL, which presents its own challenges given the state of diplomacy between the NHL and Russia.

A recent growth spurt helped Pickering rise to his current height of 6-4, and that long reach comes in handy. Pickering produced 33 points in 62 games last season for the WHL's Swift Current Broncos to show off the mobility and offensive savvy complementing his sound defensive game. There's room for Pickering to add to his explosiveness, strength on the puck and in using his body more to advantage, which will come in time. -- Shilton",,NA,NA,NA,NA

He also possesses the skill to slice through defenses and put up impressive numbers. Gaucher did that last season with QMJHL's Quebec Remparts, producing 31 goals and 57 points in 66 games. The Quebec native is good all over the ice, boasts playmaking potential and is solid in transition. With some more seasoning, he should complement the Ducks' established scorers and bring some strength and grit to the lineup too. -- Shilton",,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ivan Miroshnichenko went to the Capitals at No. 20. Danila Yurov, the other top prospect, ends up going at No. 24 to the Wild. He's a strong finisher with good goal-scoring instincts, one who sees the ice well and protects the puck.

He has a strong all-around game at both ends of the ice and a better-than-average wrist shot. What he lacks now is using that size in the attacking zone, where he tends to play more on the periphery than around the net. Given his size, that needs to change at the next level.

Kulich spent the past season with Karlovy Vary HC (Czech Republic) and handled himself well, notching nine goals and 14 points in 49 games. Kulich's real coming-out party was at the 2022 under-18 championship, where his nine goals led the field. He's got some flash, a blistering one-timer and plays a responsible game.

This 6-7 defenseman has surprising mobility, but is very much still a project. He shoots the puck a lot, but needs refinement in a lot of other facets of his game. Still, this is a good addition for a Coyotes team that can afford to wait on him.

ESPN,Brad Lambert,2022,NA,NA,12/19/03,NA,Pelicans,FINLAND,,"And just like that, the Brad Lambert Watch is over. The center was the wild card of the draft. At one point, he was a seen as a top-three pick. Then he struggled with JYP of Liiga, moved to the Lahti Pelicans and then struggled there too -- four goals in 49 games in total between both teams. But his skill is incredible, especially his speed, which makes him aesthetically perfect for a team named the Jets, one imagines. If he can ever put the total package together, he has some elite facets to his game. But consistency has not been a virtue.

The left winger was dynamic this past season, tallying 33 goals and 82 points in 60 games, and is generally good with the puck at both ends of the ice. Howard is deceptive on the ice, with a good burst of speed and finishing ability around the net. Plus, if the white suit he rocked at the draft was any indication, the kid's got some personality to wield, too.

He gives the rebuilding Blackhawks a playmaking center who is also prolific. The 17-year-old scored 71 goals and 143 points for the Regina Pats in the WHL this season.

Fantilli -- a standout freshman at the University of Michigan and the reigning Hobey Baker winner as the NCAA's top men's hockey player -- is an imposing center who will immediately make Columbus more dangerous down the middle (assuming, of course, he decides to leave the college scene). Regardless of when Fantilli slots in, he'll be able to drive his own line, elevate teammates and generate consistent production across the board. He already put together a 65-point season for the Wolverines. What would his NHL output look like out of the gate?

Gotta appreciate that. What San Jose will appreciate is the high-end skill set Smith brings to its ranks. A smart two-way center, Smith is a gifted puck handler and primetime playmaker who can make skaters around him better and contribute on special teams, particularly in a penalty killing role. And given the rebuilding mode San Jose has been through in recent years the promise of what Smith will eventually add on a regular basis has to be truly exciting.

Reinbacher was rolled out in every situation for Kloten, and that bodes well for Montreal, who can add Reinbacher to their growing stable of burgeoning young talents that will carry the franchise forward for seasons to come.

The Russian winger is signed in the KHL through the 2025-26 season though, which would give rebuilding Philadelphia time to prepare for Michkov to eventually be a prime factor in their offense. He certainly has the potential. Michkov is a skilled winger who is creative with the puck, has an excellent shot, is strong around the net and possesses a distinct slippery quality that makes him hard to contain all over the ice. Last season with the KHL's Sochi HC, Michkov put up nine goals and 20 points in 27 games. Not bad for an 18-year-old, right?

Leonard boasts a hard, accurate shot, and has a similarly hard-nosed approach to his work ethic, hounding pucks and laying hits. There's a deceptiveness in Leonard's game that makes him hard to track, and a pair of dangerous hands helped him pump in 11 goals and 20 points in 17 tournament games last season.

At 18, Barlow was the youngest captain in Attack history, a nod to those leadership skills that make Barlow an even more intriguing prospect for the Jets' system. Barlow is willing to go where other players aren't -- the ""dirty areas"" if you will -- but he's bringing so much offensive upside with him, from excellent anticipation and playmaking to a special way of simply reading the ice.

At his best, Stramel excels in tight on a goaltender and can pull off the little plays that add up to pay big dividends on the scoresheet. Plus he can elevate linemates and shows signs of being a consistent playmaker. If Stramel was underwhelming as a college newcomer, it only proves there's room for him to continue growing -- and that's what Wild GM Bill Guerin is banking on. -- Shilton",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Oliver Bonk,2023,NA,NA,1/9/05,NA,London,OHL,,"Philadelphia grabbed a dynamic scoring threat in Michkov. Now, the Flyers go with the classic shutdown defensive prospect with Bonk. He backtracks well, protects the puck, forces opponents into turnovers and really just showcases a simple game on the blue line. At 6-foot-2, Bonk can push skaters to the outside and allow his goaltender to see the puck. There's offensive upside for Bonk too; he had 10 goals and 40 points in 67 games with the OHL's London Knights last season, and put up exceptional puck possession numbers, especially in the postseason. Bonk will be a stabilizing force on the Flyers' back end when he's prepared to make the NHL jump. -- Shilton Get exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Gabriel Perreault,2023,NA,NA,5/7/05,NA,USA U-18,NTDP,,"The Rangers snagged Perreault lower than he was projected to go. But for New York, he was the definition of best available. Perreault has faced criticism for his skating and speed, but he's got a wide-ranging skill set that starts with a high hockey IQ that makes him deceptive and able to make plays all over the offensive zone. Perreault had a wildly productive season with the NTDP last season. Like most young players, Perreault will need to improve his defensive skills over time, but the bones of his game are strong. Plus, Perreault's father Yanick played 859 NHL games, so his son certainly has a strong sounding board on how to translate what he already does well to the NHL level. -- Shilton",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Tanner Molendyk,2023,NA,NA,2/3/05,NA,Saskatoon,WHL,,"Nashville went slightly off the board with Molendyk, a puck-moving defenseman with some high-end potential with continued growth. Molendyk is a great skater who won't be outworked by speedier opponents. At 5-foot-11, Molendyk isn't the biggest blueliner, but he'll still land a hit and doesn't back down when pushing forwards to the outside in his own end. There's plenty of precision in Molendyk's stick work, too. Over time he'll hone and refine those skills to be a more well-rounded NHLer for the Predators. -- Shilton",,NA,NA,NA,NA

He didn't come up with much offense last season playing against men with Frolunda HC of the Swedish League, but Stenberg projects to be more a defensive-minded, two-way forward for the Blues to potentially use in bottom-six role as opposed to a flashier top-line spot. Stenberg has a warrior mentality to him, and that grittiness can come in handy to have throughout a team's ranks. -- Shilton",,NA,NA,NA,NA

He came up with the OHL's Sudbury Wolves with excellent output (26 goals and 78 points in 53 games last season) and has been a little of everything -- playmaker, goal-scorer, and savvy on defense with vision off the rush. Musty is strong along the boards dislodging pucks, and works well in transition. The Sharks have to keep restocking the cupboards to eventually become contenders again, and Musty projects to be a forward they can roll out in a number of roles when the time comes for his NHL debut. -- Shilton",,NA,NA,NA,NA

The 18-year-old worked through a shoulder injury last season that limited his game, but Ritchie still produced at a point-per-game pace with the OHL's Oshawa Generals. Ritchie is a smart player -- he anticipates an opponent well, and can react accordingly (and quickly) to make something happen for himself or a teammate. When healthy, there aren't a ton of gaping holes in Ritchie's skill set. He could give Colorado a talent down the road that far outpaces where Ritchie was ultimately selected in this draft. -- Shilton",,NA,NA,NA,NA

Cowan is strong in transition, and can compete with high-end skaters off the rush. His intelligence and creativity will create opportunities others don't necessarily see. While Cowan might not have been one of the highest rated skaters coming into this draft, he certainly impressed the Leafs' scouts enough to make him a first-round choice, who will continue to develop through their program. -- Shilton",,NA,NA,NA,NA

He's an 18-year-old, left-shot blueliner who is not easily rattled and moves the puck well. Lindstein boasts a simple, straightforward sort of game, offering stability and strength on the back end without taking many risks. So far, Lindstein hasn't shown a great offensive upside (he grabbed just two points in 32 games with Sweden's Brynas Galve last season), but that didn't turn St. Louis off. It'll be years before the Blues see Lindstein taking on a role of any significance, but with patience he could be a solid player. -- Shilton",,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nadeau is able to create chances off the rush and is deceptive in how he moves around the ice; he makes the most of any opportunity.

Gulyayev is a great skater, he's got good gap control and doesn't shy away from challenging an opponent (of any size). Gulyayev has a strong stick and can create turnovers, which makes him dangerous at both ends of the ice. He put up two goals and 25 points in 22 games last season with Russia's Omskie Yastreby, and Colorado can take its time helping Gulyayev keep growing into himself amid their stockpile of defensive prospects. -- Shilton",,NA,NA,NA,NA

Edstrom distributes the puck well to teammates, and can add offensively in his own right. What Vegas also has to like is the way Edstrom supports on the defensive side, and can cover up on the back end. He's not flashy, but Edstrom can do a multitude of things very well.

He excels as a length of the ice player, making significant contributions on both ends. Offensively, he navigates the middle of the ice, disrupts defensive schemes and finds passing lanes that others cannot. His puck protection skills, willingness to play through contact, spin off defenders and maintain play are qualities that will translate well to the NHL. Even without the puck, he remains a scoring threat due to his ability to find open spaces, keeps his stick away from defenders and releases the puck quickly. -- Doerrie Team fit: Rebuilds require cornerstone players. Celebrini appears to be just that, considering this year's draft was commonly referred to as ""The Celebrini Draft."" Finishing with the NHL's worst record meant the Sharks had a number of areas that needed to be addressed. Among them: top-six forward help. Enter Celebrini.","While the possibility exists that Celebrini could return to BU for his sophomore year, he could step right in to the Sharks' lineup. Since 2005, the forwards who were selected with the No. 1 pick played the next season. It's a list that includes Sidney Crosby, Nathan MacKinnon, Auston Matthews, Connor McDavid and last year's No. 1 pick, Connor Bedard. Furthermore, Celebrini now officially becomes the face of a promising rebuild that already had Thomas Bordeleau, William Eklund, Mario Ferraro, Quinten Musty and the team's 2023 first-round pick in Will Smith, who is leaving Boston College after one season after signing his entry-level contract with the Sharks. -- Clark",,NA,NA,NA,NA

A right-shot defenseman, he imposes himself physically and dictates offensive play. His rapid development has led scouts to believe he could quickly become an impactful two-way defenseman in the NHL. He excels at making good first passes, finding shooting lanes and taking control of the game from the blue line. Though still raw defensively, he has tremendous upside due to his physical attributes, excellent skating ability and high puck battle success rate. Consistently engaged and a play driver at both ends of the ice, he has the potential to shift momentum. Levshunov could become a top-pairing defenseman who dictates play in transition and tilts the ice in his team's favor. -- Doerrie Team fit: The Blackhawks found their next foundational player atop last year's draft in forward Connor Bedard, who won the Calder Trophy as the NHL's Rookie of the Year on Thursday. But they also had to strip down their team to the foundations to get him. The duration of the rebuild around Bedard is entirely contingent on the players with whom they surround him. To that end, Levshunov is a huge addition, literally and figuratively.","The Blackhawks have some intriguing young defenseman in their system, but not enough of them. Kevin Korchinski played 76 games as a rookie last season and has some upside. Wyatt Kaiser split time between the Blackhawks and AHL Rockford. Sam Rinzel, selected 25th overall in 2022, had an outstanding first season with the University of Minnesota. But what they have in Levshunov is, for lack of a better label, ""The Guy."" The giant blueliner who could be their Victor Hedman. Those dynastic Lightning teams were built on offensive stars such as Steven Stamkos and Nikita Kucherov, but they won Cups thanks to the efforts of Hedman on the back end.

ESPN,Beckett Sennecke,2024,NA,NA,1/28/06,NA,Oshawa,OHL,"Offensively, it is difficult to find a weakness. He is a dual-threat menace in the offensive zone and dropped more jaws in one-on-one play than any other draft-eligible player in the OHL this season. His ability to force defenders into bad spots and manipulate his way around them is terrifying. Not only is he a threat in tight situations, but he's also a threat in transition. The puck follows him around the ice, and he slices defensive coverage with ease through excellent reads, decisive passing and a quality shot. Off the puck, he uses his awareness to win pucks back. As the season progressed, he became a nightmare on the forecheck, routinely hemming players in and winning pucks back. For lack of a better word, he's a gamer. If he wants the puck, he's more than likely going to end up with it. He's not an elite skater, but he gets to where he needs to go, plays two steps ahead of his peers and makes his teammates better. There are teams that have him in their top five, and while that is a little high for me, it is easy to understand why scouts believe Sennecke could be a top-line player. -- Doerrie Team fit: Once again, Ducks general manager Pat Verbeek went in a bit of an unexpected direction by taking Sennecke. The Ducks were in a bit of a tricky situation when it came to adding to their rebuild. Not that they couldn't have used more forwards, but they already have quite a bit of youth with Leo Carlsson, Cutter Gauthier, Mason McTavish, Troy Terry and Trevor Zegras. The same holds true with defensemen of course, with Jackson LaCombe and Pavel Mintyukov playing as rookies last season and another defenseman, Olen Zellweger, getting nine points in 26 games with the Ducks after spending the majority of the year in the AHL with the San Diego Gulls.","Now that they've added Sennecke, the Ducks have another top-six forward with size as the 6-foot-2 Sennecke will be a player who gives the Ducks another option in their attack. -- Clark Beckett Sennecke is chosen by the Anaheim Ducks with the No. 3 pick in the 2024 NHL draft.",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Cayden Lindstrom,2024,NA,NA,2/3/06,NA,Medicine Hat,WHL,"Lindstrom combines speed, size and skill, making him a dominant force at the junior level. He effectively uses his frame to protect the puck, wins battles and plays through contact in challenging areas of the ice. His physical package and skating ability make him a formidable opponent on the rush and in puck battles. If he continues to develop his ability to play through contact, he has the tools to be an excellent power forward at the NHL level. His speed in transition keeps defensemen on their heels and he changes gears to create space. Without the puck, he reads off his linemates well and finds open pockets of space. As a versatile offensive player, he knows when to use his physicality to create scoring chances or hold the puck to set up plays in the offensive zone. Although his injury history is a concern, projections indicate that Lindstrom could become a second-line center with the potential to score 70 points over a long period. He may take longer to develop, but a player with his toolbox is intriguing to many teams. -- Doerrie Team fit: This is the first Blue Jackets draft since 2012 that didn't have Jarmo Kekalainen running the table. He was dismissed as general manager earlier this season, creating an opening for one of the NHL's most interesting jobs. Columbus is a place where the bar for success is low and the talent in the prospect pool is high.","It just got higher. New GM Don Waddell, who took over the Blue Jackets after leaving the Carolina Hurricanes, had a number of options after the Ducks shocked the draft by taking Beckett Sennecke third overall. They fought some temptation and added Lindstrom. The Medicine Hat center joins center Adam Fantilli, the third overall pick in 2023 who had 27 points in 49 games this season; Kent Johnson, another Michigan alum, who is entering his fourth NHL season; and the big body and booming shot of defenseman David Jiricek as the next generation of the Blue Jackets.

His dynamic ability to create offense combines an outstanding release, elite vision and elite puckhandling skills, perhaps the best in this draft class. He's bigger and more physically mature than originally thought, which drew attention at the Florida showcase. Capable of driving play offensively, Demidov consistently took over games in the playoffs, earning the MVP award. He ranks in the top 5% for shooting and passing metrics and is a transition threat. He drives the middle from the outside and consistently gets himself to the dangerous scoring areas. As a versatile offensive player, Demidov has the potential to be a 40-goal, 40-assist producer and is the only player with a ceiling close to Celebrini's. -- Doerrie Team fit: Prior to the draft, it appeared that getting a forward was going to be the move for the Canadiens. And they fulfilled that in taking Demidov. They were in a position to take a forward last year but passed on Matvei Michkov before taking defenseman David Reinbacher. With Reinbacher being the pick last season, he added to a defensive setup that already included Kaiden Guhle, Logan Mailloux and Jayden Struble.","Concentrating on defensemen the last few years created that opening to take a forward for the second time in three years, having selected Juraj Slafkovsky with the No. 1 pick in 2022. Now the Canadiens have another top-six forward in Demidov, who at some point will make the trek to North America.

His puck skill steadily improved this season, and he became a serious offensive threat. When he has possession, Iginla displays excellent puckhandling, strong protection and a release that surprises goaltenders. He has a unique understanding of how to blend competitive physicality with elite skill, a dangerous combination. Without the puck, he finds open spaces, forechecks tenaciously and exhibits the competitiveness his father Jarome was known for. Although he needs to improve defensively, his combination of skating, puck skills, tenacity and shooting ability should enable him to contribute consistently in a top-six role, with a ceiling of a top-line winger. -- Doerrie Team fit: When the Arizona Coyotes were sold to Smith Entertainment Group and relocated to Utah, their history didn't come with them. So this is the first pick ever made by this franchise.","But their hockey operations staff was imported along with the players. That included GM Bill Armstrong, whose calling card has always been his work in scouting and drafting. That's enabled Utah to have players such as forward Logan Cooley and Dylan Guenther, who made an impact at the NHL level, as well as center Conor Geekie, defenseman Maveric Lamoureux and KHL defensemen Dmitry Simashev and Daniil But. Armstrong told me that Utah doesn't feel pressure to add a ""poster on the side of the arena"" level star for its first season in Salt Lake City, because there might be some in the organization who could fit that role. It might have another in Tij Iginla. He's got the hockey legacy of his Hall of Fame father and his own high-end talent.

ESPN,Carter Yakemchuk,2024,NA,NA,9/29/05,NA,Calgary,WHL,"Yakemchuk is an offensive difference-maker at the junior level and showed glimpses of excellent puck distribution. He dictates the power play from the point, but he needs to develop the ability to facilitate offense to take advantage of his shot in the NHL. He manipulates defenders with excellent hands, fakes and sheer power. The lack of an explosive skating stride makes him easier to defend than a more elusive skater. Defensively, he's a work in progress. His skating mobility needs to improve to be an effective transition defender in the NHL. Scouts and executives love his mean streak, as he hits to leave a mark. He gets caught puck-watching or stepping out of position to be physical. He lacks the skating step to catch opponents when they beat him in those situations, an area he needs to develop before making the jump. -- Doerrie Team fit: Drafting Yakemchuk could prove to be an intriguing move for a few reasons. The first is that this was the first time in two years the Senators used a first-round pick. It's a bit of a bizarre dynamic for a franchise that's been trying to shed the title of rebuild and transition into a playoff team, only to miss the postseason for the past seven campaigns.","That said, Yakemchuk gives it a young defenseman who adds to a group that already has Thomas Chabot, Jakob Chychrun, Jake Sanderson and Jacob Bernard-Docker, among others. But that also comes with the understanding that Chychrun's future with the club is in question. He has a year left on his contract before hitting free agency. He could either sign a new deal or the Sens could trade him. Either way, they'll have options, and getting Yakemchuk will now play a big role in that dynamic. -- Clark",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Berkly Catton,2024,NA,NA,1/14/06,NA,Spokane,WHL,"Catton is one of those ""get you out of your seats"" players. He's dynamic with the puck, reads defensive structures, slices through coverage and is a nightmare to defend in one-on-one situations. His ability to manipulate defenders with his speed and skill is pure brilliance. He's one of the most dangerous transition players in the draft, and even at 5-10, he's shown an ability to execute high-skill plays in traffic. As is the case with any player of this skill set, he needs to pick his spots a little better to improve his offensive efficiency. The turnovers are not going to fly at the NHL level, and he'll need to develop his ability to create offense when he's not in transition. The same manipulation, stick skill and deception he uses on the rush needs to be applied in smaller areas. If he can take pucks off the wall and get to the middle, there is a better chance he hits his ceiling of a top-six, point producer. He's already a dual threat with a promising arsenal of releases and shot types. Given that he understands how to put defenders in vulnerable postures, it is not a stretch to believe his offensive game will continue to improve. I'm not sure he's a center in the NHL, but the dynamic dual threat should be an entertaining player to watch for years. -- Doerrie Team fit: Entering the draft, the narrative surrounding the Kraken was that they needed to draft a defenseman. Namely, a puck mover who could help facilitate possession for a team that's struggled to score goals in two of their first three seasons. Although the argument could be had that they already have that with Ryker Evans.","It still amounted to the Kraken needing prospects who can score or create goals and it led to them choosing Berkly Catton. He addresses their scoring needs provided he scored 54 goals and 116 points for the Spokane Chiefs last season. If the Kraken opt to keep Catton at center, he will join their spine of the future that includes Matty Beniers and Shane Wright. But there's a chance he could be moved to the wing, with the expectation that he could someday play alongside Beniers on one of the Kraken's top two lines and on their power play. -- Clark",,NA,NA,NA,NA

His statistics and model projections stand out, surpassing every other defenseman except Levshunov. He is clearly in the top tier, projected as a top-four offensive catalyst with an over 80% chance of playing 200-plus NHL games. Right-handed offensive dynamos are rare and seldom available via trade. Parekh has all the qualities of a top-notch power-play quarterback and even-strength play driver, capable of scoring upward of 60 points per season in the NHL. He had one of the best draft-eligible seasons in CHL history, which should not be overlooked. His elite four-way mobility allows him to evade opponents and create space effortlessly. His defensive game improved throughout the OHL season, and while it's not as robust as some might prefer, his skating and hockey sense equip him to defend effectively at the NHL level. His offensive instincts are innate and form the foundation of his play-driving offense. Combine his offensive instincts with demonstrated ability to move pucks to dangerous areas, create shooting opportunities and get pucks through, and Parekh presents an intriguing package. His ceiling is the highest among defensemen in the draft, confidently projecting him as an impactful top-four defenseman over a lengthy NHL career. -- Doerrie Team fit: The pick wasn't Tij Iginla and that's going to be a bummer for a lot of Flames fans. But Zayne Parekh is a solid choice and a player who will certainly help with Calgary's rebuild ... retool ... whatever it is that GM Craig Conroy is doing with this franchise, which is content to ship out some veterans (Jacob Markstrom, Andrew Mangiapane), while holding onto others (like reportedly, Nazem Kadri). They have some quality young players up front such as winger Matt Coronato, who played 35 games in the NHL; center Connor Zary, who had a strong rookie season with 34 points in 63 games; and a big forward in Samuel Honzek.","Now they add Parekh, a player who has electrifying offensive upside. Parekh is the first defenseman the Flames selected in the first round since Juuso Valimaki at No. 16 in 2017.

While he isn't expected to be dynamic in the NHL, his developing offensive skills suggest he could become a 35- to 40-point producer. He skates very well, with good edgework and agility, which is evident in his defensive transitions and his movement along the offensive blue line. If he can add strength without losing mobility, he could become a high-minute defenseman in the NHL, capable of shutting down the opposition's best players. His floor is higher than other top defensive prospects due to his proven ability to succeed in the KHL. Scouts are high on his skating ability, physicality and transition defense. There are concerns about his ability to read the play and make good puck decisions. He will need time to enhance his ability to facilitate breakouts, transition offense and read pressure. --Doerrie Team fit: There was plenty of speculation that the Devils would move this pick -- it was certainly in play in the hours leading up to the draft. But New Jersey kept it and added to the deepest part of its prospect pool: the blue line.","Anton Silayev is a 6-7 mountain, a defensive defenseman who has tremendous skating ability and a fantastic reach. They moved 24-year-old Kevin Bahl, who is 6-6, for goalie Jacob Markstrom. Silayev more than fits in as an eventual replacement. He joins Calder Trophy finalist Luke Hughes, Simon Nemec and eventually Seamus Casey as the defensive foundations for years to come. -- Wyshynski",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Sam Dickinson,2024,NA,NA,6/7/06,NA,London,OHL,"Dickinson is one of the best all-around skating defensemen in the draft, and it is particularly evident in transition. Offensively, he carries the puck with ease, evades defenders, cuts to the middle and creates scoring chances. Defensively, he maintains a good gap, matches opponent's speed and finishes his checks. His shot is above average, but he is unlikely to overpower goalies at the NHL level. His skating and defensive abilities will carry him in the NHL. These are all attributes scouts and coaches love. It is easy to see why the model projects him to be a top-four defender with a puncher's chance of being a top-pairing guy. The big question with Dickinson is decision-making on both sides of the puck. At the junior level, he's so evasive and above his peers in the skating department, that it masks some awareness issues. On the rush, he can skate himself into trouble and make life more complicated when a simpler play exists. In the defensive zone, he gets caught on the wrong side of players and makes questionable decisions with the puck after he wins a battle. He's a solid athlete who will play in the NHL, but time will tell if he can develop his awareness and reads to take advantage of his skills and become a difference-maker. -- Doerrie Team fit: When the Sharks traded up to No. 11 on Thursday, it came with the expectation that they were going to use that pick to get a defenseman, especially considering they already had Celebrini, in addition to forwards such as Bordeleau, Eklund, Musty and Smith. And that's not including who they took in 2022, center Filip Bystedt.","That belief only intensified by the time the Sharks picked at 11, as defensemen such as Zeev Buium and Sam Dickinson were still available when it came time for their second pick of the first round. They chose Dickinson, who gives them a sizable defenseman who can not only serve in a top-pairing role but can also be at the controls of a power play.

ESPN,Zeev Buium,2024,NA,NA,12/7/05,NA,Denver,NCHC,"One of the best defensemen in college hockey this season, Buium is confidently projected as a top-four defenseman in the NHL. He consistently stands out by joining the rush, defending well in transition and excelling in man-to-man defense in his own zone. He's an elite two-way defenseman at the college level and is likely the most efficient puck mover in this draft class. He shows elite hockey sense and seems to be two to three plays ahead, allowing him to make plays that other players can't. Defensively, he maintains a tight gap, adapts to changes in pace and uses excellent edgework to avoid getting beaten in tight situations. His puck skills, combined with various head and shoulder fakes, enable him to create space and passing lanes. If there is a better one-on-one defenseman in this draft, I've yet to see him. Buium elevates his play as games intensify and was one of Team USA's best players at the World Juniors as an underage player, in addition to being a crucial part of the NCAA champion Denver blue line. With all the qualities of a play-driving, momentum-shifting defenseman, Buium could be ready for the NHL by the end of the 2024-25 college season. -- Doerrie Team fit: GM Bill Guerin got aggressive here to select Zeev Buium, and rightfully so. Buium has a high hockey IQ and can be someone that can run an NHL power play, leading all NCAA defenseman in points last season (50). Denver depended on him big time in winning the national title this season -- he played 31 minutes against Boston University in the semifinal and more than 29 minutes against Boston College for the title.",He's an impact player and the highest defenseman the Wild have taken since Matt Dumba at seventh overall in 2012. -- Wyshynski,,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Jett Luchanko,2024,NA,NA,8/21/06,NA,Guelph,OHL,"Luchanko has all the makings of a dream bottom-six role. Given the offensive instincts and abilities he has shown this season, Luchanko has a better ability to drive play than many believe. He's an excellent two-way player, a rare feat for a very young player in a draft class. The combination of production, development and a later birthday give Luchanko a projection closer to middle six than bottom six. Luchanko was the main beneficiary of Matthew Poitras' move to the Bruins, allowing him to become the primary driver on both sides of the puck. His skating takes the pace of the game to another level, forcing his opponents to play at speeds in which they are uncomfortable. His ability to dictate the play is eye-opening, beating defenders clean with his speed while being a royal pain to deal with on the forecheck and backcheck. He is in the middle of everything that happens, showing off a detail-oriented game that includes awareness, shiftiness and skill that scouts love. -- Doerrie Team fit: Trading down to No. 13 earned some extra draft capital. But they also landed a center in Jett Luchanko that adds to a future that already includes Noah Cates, Joel Farabee, Tyson Foerster and Matvei Michkov. Even with that many forwards, the Flyers were still in need of a center. That made Luchanko or Konsta Helenius an option.","The last time they drafted a center in the first round was in 2018 when they took Jay O'Brien, who they did not sign (and earned a compensatory pick this year for it). Prior to that, It was 2017 when they took Nolan Patrick with the second pick and Morgan Frost at 27. Patrick was traded, while Frost remains with the club. Luchanko gives the Flyers someone who projects as a two-way option who could be anchoring one of the lines of a rebuild that took a significant step forward in 2023-24. -- Clark Philadelphia native Michael Buffer announces that Jett Luchanko is headed to the Flyers.",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Konsta Helenius,2024,NA,NA,5/11/06,NA,Jukurit,FINLAND,"Helenius is excellent defensively, and his play is immediately projectable to the NHL. Offensively, he is effective, not flashy. He retrieves pucks, enters the zone with possession, creates space with effective body positioning and relies on his elite hockey sense to make sound decisions offensively. The combination of his competitiveness, hockey sense and puck management make him a highly effective and reliable player in all three zones. He lacks dynamic attributes that other players in the draft class possess, but he makes up for that his in his ability to be the engine of his line. He consistently drives play and showed flashes of offensive creativity, but Helenius does not have a standout offensive attribute. He's a well-rounded, length-of-the-ice player who will be impactful on both sides of the puck at the NHL level. Scouts see some Mikael Backlund in him, which is high praise for the young Finn. A second-line center/top penalty killer who can drive play at even strength is something every contender needs. That is Helenius. If his offense develops, there's a chance he fits the mold of a Joel Eriksson Ek or Elias Lindholm type of player. -- Doerrie Team fit: The Sabres traded down this week, acquiring the Devils' No. 42 overall pick in their flip-flop with the Sharks. Helenius is a solid two-way center who joins a depth chart that includes Tage Thompson, Dylan Cozens, Peyton Krebs, Matthew Savoie, Jiri Kulich and Noah Ostlund.","Obviously, some of them could shift to the wing, but the bottom line is that the Sabres have a ton of talent on the way up front, to go along with the foundational defensemen in Rasmus Dahlin and Owen Power. -- Wyshynski",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Michael Brandsegg-Nygård,2024,NA,NA,10/5/05,NA,Mora,SWEDEN-2,"The Norwegian forward is one of the most well-rounded players in the draft. The blend of grit, skill and in-tight scoring ability has scouts believing he is a Swiss Army knife at the NHL level. There is belief that he could be the best two-way forward in the draft not named Celebrini. Defensively, he may be the best forward in the draft. He is consistently in the right positions, makes excellent reads in defensive transition and reads off his teammates well to support the puck. His ability to retrieve pucks, win puck battles and position his body in ways that make it nearly impossible to knock him off the puck will only improve has he physically matures and adds strength. He's unafraid to deliver a board-shaking body check to shift momentum, but does not put himself out of position to do so. He separates opponents from the puck, drives forward and uses his powerful frame to cut to the middle or the net. If there is a weakness in his defensive game, I have yet to find it. The drawback with Brandsegg-Nygard is that he isn't dynamic. His ceiling isn't as high as other players, but his floor is higher than nearly every forward outside of the top five. There is little doubt he will be a middle-six power forward who will be deployed to shut down opponent's best players and finish offensive opportunities in tight. As one scout put it, ""He isn't the guy you build around, but certainly the type of player that every contender wants in the middle of their lineup."" -- Doerrie Team fit: What's this? The Red Wings went into Europe and drafted a player?","In all seriousness, Brandsegg-Nygard was thought to be a player who could have gone in this range, so it wasn't like the Red Wings reached. Detroit has used two of its most recent first-round picks to get centers. It's just that Brandsegg-Nygard gives it another potential top-six winger. And given how the Wings are currently set up with their forward depth, Brandsegg-Nygard has a good chance to break onto the scene in the near future. -- Clark",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Adam Jiricek,2024,NA,NA,6/28/06,NA,Plzen,CZECHIA,"The 6-2, right-handed defenseman has been on scouting radars for years, allowing for his game to be put under the microscope. He's competitive, makes good puck decisions and activates in the play. Losing nearly a full season of development during the most crucial years makes for a more difficult evaluation and model projection. Jiricek's numbers are very volatile, and the draft year sample is not large enough for a confident projection. The tools to be an impactful defenseman are there, with good reads, aggressive defensive posture, strong puck retrieval skills and physicality. He needs the skating, which obviously took a developmental hit when he tore an ACL, to improve by a step and half or two to take advantage of his other skills. His stride lacks the explosive and aggressive attributes to complement the rest of his game and will hinder his ability to utilize other skills if he can't keep pace. He has a longer runway to develop because he's inexperienced and lost nearly a year of development to his injury. There is a real chance he becomes a second-pairing defenseman and an outside shot at the top pair. -- Doerrie Team fit: The Blues really needed to add some talent to their defense prospects -- they hadn't drafted a defenseman in the first round since Jordan Schmaltz in 2012 -- and Jiricek is a terrific choice. He gained great experience playing in the Czech league, and as a right-shot defenseman he's a valuable commodity.","Jiricek might not have the ceiling of his brother, David, who went sixth overall to the Blue Jackets in 2022, but he's certainly got some upside. -- Wyshynski",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Terik Parascak,2024,NA,NA,5/28/06,NA,Prince George,WHL,"His production is reminiscent of a player who should be selected in top half of the first round. His skating, like Jason Robertson's in 2017, worries scouts. He doesn't have the physical package of Robertson, but his production is much better. Parascak has all the capabilities to be a dual threat at the NHL level if his skating improves. Parascak's instincts on and off the puck are high-end. He understands defensive schemes and how to penetrate them, but his skating holds him back from driving play. This is evident in transition, where he lacks the pace to attack the middle and relies on his instincts to find open space and arrive at the perfect time. When he gets the puck in space, he's terrifying. His catch and release shot, one-timer and ability to shoot opposite his momentum make him challenging for goalies to stop. A team taking Parascak is getting a player with an elite hockey sense and many shots in his arsenal. If he can add strength and more power to his skating, there is a real chance he's a top-six, difference-maker in the NHL. He's unlikely to be a true play driver, but a complementary player who can ignite a power play. -- Doerrie Team fit: Using their first-round picks to select top-six forwards they believe can provide a sense of offensive consistency going forward has been the plan for the Caps the past few years. The decision to take Parascak fits within that dynamic. Parascak was one of a few forwards who could have been picked at this spot.","When the time comes, he'll be the latest prospect to come through a farm system that has watched its AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears, win Calder Cups while continuing to send the organization's homegrown talents to the NHL. -- Clark",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Sacha Boisvert,2024,NA,NA,3/17/06,NA,Muskegon,USHL,"Boisvert can really shoot the puck, and regardless of where he receives it, he is a threat. He gets pucks through layers with accuracy and has excellent hands to finish plays at the net front. There is reason to believe his deceptive release will transfer to the NHL level, but if it does not, his ability to finish plays in tight will surely make him worthy of attention. Without the puck, Boisvert is still impactful. He tracks back well, disrupts transition play and delivers hard hits to separate players from the puck. There's a noticeable edge to his game that will only improve as he gets stronger. His skating posture is off balance, and he lacks the explosiveness required to create more space offensively. An improved skating stride with more power and better ability to read defensive coverage will allow Boisvert to take advantage of his NHL-ready shot and two-way game. -- Doerrie Team fit: The assumption was that the Blackhawks would go with a forward here after taking Levshunov at second overall. Boisvert offers a great contrast to the way Connor Bedard plays at center -- a two-way game with some physicality. He aspires to be an Evgeni Malkin-like player in the NHL. Not a bad gamble for the Blackhawks to take, considering they already have their Sidney Crosby. -- Wyshynski",,,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Trevor Connelly,2024,NA,NA,2/28/06,NA,Tri-City,USHL,"On talent and talent alone, the model projects him to be a top-six forward with a fair chance at a top-line role. There are only a few players with better offensive attributes than Connelly, and they will go in the top 10. He leaves a lot to be desired defensively but should get a healthy dose of development at Providence College. He is unlikely to be a two-way player, and that's not his style. His style is flash, dash and pizzazz -- a player with a true wow factor. Connelly has a lot of maturing to do on and off the ice. The selfish major and misconduct at the under-18 championship kick-started the collapse against Canada in the gold medal game. Quite a few teams have designated him as ""do not draft"" due the information revealed in a story from The Athletic. As one NHL head scout put it, ""top-10 talent, bottom-10 character. Can't do it."" The definition of high-risk, high-reward for all the wrong reasons. -- Doerrie Team fit: There's a possibility that the Golden Knights have reached the point that they could start to incorporate prospects as they continue to challenge for the Stanley Cup. It's possible that drafting Connolly could work out one of two ways for the Golden Knights. He could be a player who works his way into the lineup as a productive winger on a team-friendly deal to help offset some of their salary cap issues. Or he could be used in a potential trade to help the Golden Knights get a player they covet.","Whatever path the Golden Knights take, it'll come with the win-at-all costs mentality that's continued to define them. -- Clark",,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Cole Eiserman,2024,NA,NA,8/29/06,NA,USA U-18,NTDP,"Eiserman is considered the best pure scorer in the draft, though opinions about him vary widely. His impressive goal totals with the national team development program are hard to ignore, yet he often leaves scouts wanting more. With the best shot in the draft, his projection suggests he could score 35 to 40 goals per season if he reaches his ceiling. As a young player in the draft, he has more runway to improve his decision-making and develop a well-rounded offensive game. While habits can be fixed and skating will continue to improve, scoring instincts and the ability to catch and release the puck from awkward positions are innate, and Eiserman excels in both areas. There are times he tries to do too much with the puck, leading to turnovers and forced shots -- habits that can frustrate scouts and coaches. Despite this, his potential as a 40-goal scorer is undeniable if developed with patience. The model is confident he will produce at the NHL level in a top-six role. Eiserman has the talent to be an even-strength scorer, power-play asset and most importantly, a difference-maker. -- Doerrie Team fit: Leave it to Lou Lamoriello to punch consensus in the face. Cole Eiserman is one of the best goal-scorers in the draft, whose stock had fallen due to criticisms of his defensive game. The Islanders certainly needed an infusion of high-end offensive talent in their prospect pool. Eiserman is the embodiment of the ""you can't teach offense"" mindset. -- Wyshynski",,,NA,NA,NA,NA
ESPN,Michael Hage,2024,NA,NA,4/14/06,NA,Chicago,USHL,"A big, right-handed center who is a dual threat in the offensive zone and showed one of the most promising development curves of the season? Check. Check. Check. A dynamic transitioner of the puck, Hage is a cerebral player who picks apart defensive schemes in transition with ease. He gets the puck off the wall to the dangerous areas of the ice better than most players in the draft. The deceptiveness of his shot and the array of shots in his arsenal makes him equally dangerous with and without the puck. He can pull the puck and fire it through defenders as easily as he receives the puck and releases in a single motion. A heady player, Hage understands how to manipulate defenders and open up shooting lanes. If he can add a step to his pace, he will be able to take advantage of the compromising positions he puts defenders in. There are many parts of Hage's game that scouts love outside of his physical gifts. He wins puck battles, gets to the net front and makes his teammates better. He will develop hard skill by improving his ability to take contact and use it to his advantage. The details of his game are a strong point. He supports the puck well, and his ability to impact the game will only improve as his skating takes a step. The model sees him as a middle-six player with an outside chance at hitting his second-line ceiling. -- Doerrie Team fit: After taking Demidov at No. 5, the Canadiens used their second first-round pick to take another forward in Hage. The expectation with Hage is that he could give them a two-way center for the future.","Hypothetically speaking, the Canadiens might not be in any rush, as they're set up with Nick Suzuki and Alex Newhook down the middle for at least three more years. Hage will spend next season playing at the University of Michigan which has recently developed a number of centers such as Matty Beniers, Thomas Bordeleau and Brendan Brisson, among others. -- Clark",,NA,NA,NA,NA

If I were giving each draft-eligible a superlative or vibe, Beaudoin's would be ""gamer."" The model is lower on him than this ranking, but the belief that he should become a bottom-six player that checks well, kills penalties and bring energy to the lineup. A big, strong player who may be most effective on the wing at the NHL level, Beaudoin reads the play well, gets into traffic, wins nearly every puck battle and grinds opponents down. There is no OHL player who enjoys going into the corner with him -- and more than a few came out worse for wear. He's got the strength and desire to be an impactful physical player in the NHL. If his skating continues to improve, there is reason to believe he has a higher ceiling than current projections indicate. Utah will need a more patient approach with him, but added pace could see him jump into a third-line role as a player coaches trust implicitly. -- Doerrie Team fit: GM Bill Armstrong had a treasure trove of draft picks and decided to dip into them swap with Colorado, sending the 38th, 71st and the Rangers' 2025 second-rounder to the Avalanche. That's because it was widely expected that the Bruins were going to select Beaudoin with the next selection.","Utah gets a strong center who plays with physical tenacity, a puck-swarming forward that fits in well on the UHC depth chart. -- Wyshynski",,NA,NA,NA,NA

ESPN,Liam Greentree,2024,NA,NA,1/1/06,NA,Windsor,OHL,"Greentree has many attributes that scouts love -- he plays in the middle of the ice, sees the ice very well, is an adept playmaker and a throwback build in the style of a power forward. He ranks highly across the board from his physical game to his hockey sense to his high-end playmaking. He lacks in the most important, yet most easily improvable, area: skating. Were Greentree an average or slightly above average skater, he likely would've been a top-10 pick because he's that good in the other areas of his game. Greentree was effectively a one-man show on a rebuilding Windsor team. His production is likely 20% better on a team that doesn't finish near the bottom of the OHL standings. Not only is he a quality offensive driver, but he is also reliable defensively. He gets himself in good positions, wins puck battles and routinely outmuscles opponents all over the ice. He's fun to watch because you wonder how he is as effective as he is with his skating deficiencies. Scouts and executives have expressed an admiration for his game. His puckhandling, vision and shot make him a problem to deal with in the offensive zone. There are a lot of tools to work with and wouldn't be the first prospect to improve his skating after being drafted. The problem with Greentree's skating is that it is enough of a concern in today's league that if it doesn't improve, he may not be able to keep up. Functionally big and skilled power wingers are hard to find nowadays, and Greentree is exactly that. If he does add a step or two to his game, there's a good chance he's a top-six point producer at the NHL level. -- Doerrie Team fit: The Kings picked up this pick when Montreal traded up to No. 21 to select center Michael Hage. Greentree was captain of the Windsor Spitfires, and has a big body and a smart offensive game.","He joins a group of young forwards with the Kings that includes burgeoning star Quinton Byfield, Alex Laferriere and hopefully Alex Turcotte, who hasn't developed as quickly as the others.

Hemming is one of the few players who the model predicts he has more than an 80% chance of playing 200 NHL games with less than a 10% chance of becoming a star -- true ""safe"" vibes. He's a strong two-way player with a quality release that borders on being a separating skill. He can shoot off both legs, off balance and in many catch-and-release positions. He's a threat to score from distance, gets pucks through defenders and can score when he drives the net. He understands how to use contact to his advantage, wins puck battles, is in excellent spots off the puck and never cheats defensively. Those hard skills should easily translate into a bottom-six role, and he's likely ready for the AHL next season. Offensively, there have been flashes of good puck distribution and hockey sense. However, he is reliant on his shooting ability and two-way play. If he can add a step to his skating, there is legitimate upside as a power forward who contributes 40 to 50 points per season, playing on a top penalty-killing unit and secondary power-play unit. The ceiling isn't as high as that of other players, but he is far more likely to play meaningful games. -- Doerrie Team fit: No matter who the Stars selected at No. 29, the pick was going to be met with the expectation that they would be the latest success story in Dallas' prospect pipeline. So the fact they took Emil Hemming only adds to the belief that he could be the next prospect who might be able to contribute quickly.","He had 11 goals and 18 points in 13 games while playing against under-20 competition in Finland, while scoring seven goals and 11 points in 40 points against older competition in Liiga, the highest level of hockey in the nation. -- Clark",,NA,NA,NA,NA

Emery is a perfect complementary piece to an elite offensive defenseman who needs a reliable partner to augment their game. Emery is a top transition defenseman, whose one-on-one defensive play stands out. He maintains excellent posture, effectively uses his stick to guide opponents, takes away passes and pokes pucks off opponent's sticks. In transition, he maintains good gap control, doesn't allow attackers to beat him to the outside and forces them to relinquish the puck. When the game needs a calming presence, the opponent's best players kept off the scoresheet and a quality defensive play, Emery is that player. From that perspective, he is a coach's dream. His defensive development this season has me believing he will continue to improve and likely become one of the best defenders in the draft class. Offensively, there is not a lot there. That isn't Emery's calling card. That is likely why the model doesn't project him to be more than a second-pairing defenseman. He makes simple breakout passes and doesn't get caught up ice. While that is generally concerning, as a lack of offense at the junior level leads to a less confident statistical projection, his ability to defend in all three zones, skate well and win physical battles should make him a top-four defenseman in the NHL. -- Doerrie Team fit: There was a sense ahead of the draft that if the Rangers kept this pick, they were going defense. They selected a solid one here.","Emery is a right-handed shot who skates well and has a strong physical game without chasing hits. He projects to be a top-four defenseman.
